## Code and Structure

Try to stick to golang best practices and standards.
Package structure standards can be found here: https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout

## Issues

If applicable use the issue template. This ensures a consistent structure which makes it easier to find important details.
Issues which aren't ready for processing, can be marked as a draft by writing "Draft: " infront of the issue name.

## Pull Requests

Use the Pull Request Template. This ensures a consistent structure which makes it easier to find important details.
Set yourself and any other collaborators as assignee.

## Pre Commit

It is recommended to install pre-commit. This insures that formatting is consistent, you don't commit to protected branches and you don't accidentally commit broken code or new functionality without changing the tests. The installation process is in the [README](README.md#setting-up-pre-commit)
