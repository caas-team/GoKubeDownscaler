## Code and Structure

Try to stick to golang best practices and standards:

<!-- keep this list updated everytime someone opens a pr with best practice issues  -->

- Package structure standards: https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout
- Use guard clauses if applicable
- Try to avoid using else. Most of the time these can be replaced by just placing the else block content directly after the if or by refactoring the if block to be an additional function.
- Comments on funcs/types (esp. public ones)
- Only make functions public if necessary

## Issues

If applicable use the issue template. This ensures a consistent structure which makes it easier to find important details.
Issues which aren't ready for processing, can be marked as a draft by writing "Draft: " infront of the issue name.

## Pull Requests

Use the Pull Request Template. This ensures a consistent structure which makes it easier to find important details.
Set yourself and any other collaborators as assignee.

## Pre Commit

It is recommended to install pre-commit. This insures that formatting is consistent, you don't commit to protected branches and you don't accidentally commit broken code or new functionality without changing the tests. The installation process is in the [README](README.md#setting-up-pre-commit)
