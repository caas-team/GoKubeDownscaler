# Configurations

This documentation page lists all the configurations available for the Downscaler.
As specified in the [downscaler concepts](ref:docs-scopes-and-scaling) page, there are two types of configurations:

- **Runtime Configurations:** define how the Downscaler itself operates, controlling aspects like which namespaces and
  workload types it should target, frequency of scans, retries, whether debugging information is enabled and more.
  Runtime Configurations do not dictate how and when individual workloads are scaled.
- **Values:** define the scaling behavior of targeted workloads, specifying how and when they should be scaled up or
  down.

The following sections cover the available configurations for each type
