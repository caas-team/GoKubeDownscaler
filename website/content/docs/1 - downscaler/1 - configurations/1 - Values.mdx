# Values

**Values** define the scaling behavior of targeted workloads, specifying how and when they should be scaled up or down.
They can be set at any [scope](ref:docs-scopes-and-scaling) and therefore can be set via their respective
[environment variables](ref:docs-env-scope), [cli arguments](ref:docs-cli-scope),
[namespace annotations](ref:docs-namespace-scope) and [workload annotations](ref:docs-workload-scope)

:::note

The default values shown below are only set on [the default scope](ref:docs-default-scope).

:::

## Order

Some of the values have a specific order in which they are evaluated.
This means that some values take precedence over others.

### Exclusion

Exclusion contains all values which exclude the workload (e.g. [Exclude](#exclude), [Exclude Until](#exclude-until), [Grace Period](#grace-period)).

If any of these values exclude the workload, it will not be scaled.

### Scaling

Scaling includes all values which influence the state of Scaling the workload should be in
(e.g. [Force Downtime](#force-downtime), [Force Uptime](#force-uptime), [Downscale Period](#downscale-period),
[Downtime](#downtime), [Upscale Period](#upscale-period), [Uptime](#uptime)).

If [Force Downtime](#force-downtime) or [Force Uptime](#force-uptime) is
true/[matching](ref:docs-timespans) during scaling their respective scaling will be used.
Otherwise the [Downscale Period](#downscale-period), [Downtime](#downtime),
[Upscale Period](#upscale-period) and [Uptime](#uptime) values are evaluated.

:::note

Currently if [Downscale Period](#downscale-period) and [Upscale Period](#upscale-period) is set,
and both match the same time the workload will ignore scaling.
This is _**NOT**_ final intended behavior and you should not rely on this.
This will likely change in the future to be seen as an incompatibility.

:::

## Value Groups

Some values within a scope set/define very similar properties (e.g. [Force Downtime](#force-downtime)
and [Force Uptime](#force-uptime); [Downscale Period](#downscale-period),
[Downtime](#downtime), [Upscale Period](#upscale-period) and [Uptime](#uptime))

These values are not all handled separately when choosing which scope to take the values from.
Instead if one of them is set in a scope, the other values will be taken from the same scope.

Incompatibilities between values normally only occur between values in the same value group and therefore the values on that same scope.

## List Of Values

Here is a list of all values that can be set on the Downscaler.

### Downscale Period

- Type: [Timespans](ref:docs-timespans)
- Default: []
- Within these periods the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) will be scaled down.
  Outside of the periods, scaling will be ignored/overwritten by [Upscale Period](#upscale-period).
- Can be paired with [upscale period](#upscale-period)
- Incompatible with [Downtime](#downtime) and [Uptime](#uptime)
- [Grouped](#value-groups) with [downtime](#downtime),
  [uptime](#uptime) and [upscale period](#upscale-period)
- Where to set: [ENV Scope](ref:docs-env-scope#values), [Namespace Scope](ref:docs-namespace-scope#values),
  [Workload Scope](ref:docs-workload-scope#values)

### Downtime

- Type: [Timespans](ref:docs-timespans)
- Default: []
- Within these periods the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) will be scaled down.
  Outside of the periods the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) will be scaled up.
- Incompatible with [downscale period](#downscale-period), [upscale period](#upscale-period) and [Uptime](#uptime)
- [Grouped](#value-groups) with [downscale period](#downscale-period),
  [uptime](#uptime) and [upscale period](#upscale-period)
- Where to set: [ENV Scope](ref:docs-env-scope#values), [Namespace Scope](ref:docs-namespace-scope#values),
  [Workload Scope](ref:docs-workload-scope#values)

### Upscale Period

- Type: [Timespans](ref:docs-timespans)
- Default: []
- Within these periods the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) will be scaled up.
  Outside of the periods, scaling will be ignored/overwritten by [Downscale Period](#downscale-period).
- Can be paired with [downscale period](#downscale-period)
- Incompatible with [Downtime](#downtime) and [Uptime](#uptime)
- [Grouped](#value-groups) with [downscale period](#downscale-period),
  [uptime](#uptime) and [Downtime](#downtime)
- Where to set: [ENV Scope](ref:docs-env-scope#values), [Namespace Scope](ref:docs-namespace-scope#values),
  [Workload Scope](ref:docs-workload-scope#values)

### Uptime

- Type: [Timespans](ref:docs-timespans)
- Default: []
- Within these periods the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) will be scaled up.
  Outside of the periods the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) will be scaled down.
- Incompatible with [downscale period](#downscale-period), [upscale period](#upscale-period) and [Downtime](#downtime)
- [Grouped](#value-groups) with [downscale period](#downscale-period),
  [upscale period](#upscale-period) and [Downtime](#downtime)
- Where to set: [ENV Scope](ref:docs-env-scope#values), [Namespace Scope](ref:docs-namespace-scope#values),
  [Workload Scope](ref:docs-workload-scope#values)

### Exclude

- Type: [Timespans](ref:docs-timespans) (this also includes [true/false](ref:docs-timespans#alwaysnevertruefalse))
- Default: false
- Excludes the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) from being scaled. (Scaling is ignored)
- Where to set: [Namespace Scope](ref:docs-namespace-scope#values), [Workload Scope](ref:docs-workload-scope#values)

### Exclude Until

- Type: [RFC3339 timestamp](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339)
- Default: none
- Excludes the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) from being scaled until the set time. (Scaling is ignored)
- Where to set: [Namespace Scope](ref:docs-namespace-scope#values), [Workload Scope](ref:docs-workload-scope#values)

### Force Uptime

- Type: [Timespans](ref:docs-timespans) (this also includes [true/false](ref:docs-timespans#alwaysnevertruefalse))

### Downscale Replicas

- Type: [Integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer)
- Default: 0

### Grace Period

- Type: [Duration](ref:docs-duration)
- Default: 15 minutes
- The Duration a workload has to exist for until being scaled the first time.

  instead of the creation time when set.
