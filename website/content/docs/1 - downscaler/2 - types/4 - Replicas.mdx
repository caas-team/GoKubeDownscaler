# Replicas

Replicas is a struct that holds the value of the desired number of replicas or the desired percentage
value for scaling workloads.

## Syntax

Replicas can be represented as an integer for all workloads

```text
2 Â·# 2 Replicas
```

Replicas can also be represented as a string percentage exclusively when targeting PodDisruption Budgets

```text
50% # 50% of the current replicas
```

:::warning

A percentage value cannot be used inside a Scope that is also targeting workloads other than PodDisruptionBudgets.
For
example, you cannot use a percentage value inside the [CLI Scope](ref:docs-cli-scope) or the
[Namespace Scope](ref:docs-namespace-scope) if you are also targeting Deployments, StatefulSets, or other workload types.
This will result in an error on scaling workloads that do not support percentage scaling.
