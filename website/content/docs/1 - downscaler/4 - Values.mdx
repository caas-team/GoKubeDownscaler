# Values

Values are configuration values which decide scaling parameters.
They can be set at any [scope](ref:docs-scopes) and therefore can be set via their respective
[environment variables](ref:docs-environment-variables), [cli arguments](ref:docs-arguments), [namespace annotations and workload annotations](ref:docs-annotations)

:::note

The default values shown below are only set on [the default scope](ref:docs-scopes#default-scope).

:::

## Order

Some of the values have a specific order in which they are evaluated.
This means that some values take precedence over others.

### Exclusion

Exclusion contains all values which exclude the workload (e.g. [Exclude](#exclude), [Exclude Until](#exclude-until), [Grace Period](#grace-period)).

If any of these values exclude the workload, it will not be scaled.

### Scaling

Scaling includes all values which influence the state of Scaling the workload should be in
(e.g. [Force Downtime](#force-downtime), [Force Uptime](#force-uptime), [Downscale Period](#downscale-period),
[Downtime](#downtime), [Upscale Period](#upscale-period), [Uptime](#uptime)).

If [Force Downtime](#force-downtime) or [Force Uptime](#force-uptime) is
true/[matching](ref:docs-timespans) during scaling their respective scaling will be used.
Otherwise the [Downscale Period](#downscale-period), [Downtime](#downtime),
[Upscale Period](#upscale-period) and [Uptime](#uptime) values are evaluated.

:::note

Currently if [Downscale Period](#downscale-period) and [Upscale Period](#upscale-period) is set,
and both match the same time the workload will ignore scaling.
This is _**NOT**_ final intended behavior and you should not rely on this.
This will likely change in the future to be seen as an incompatibility.

## Downscale Period

- Type: [Timespans](ref:docs-timespans)
- Default: []
- Within these periods the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) will be scaled down.
  Outside of the periods, scaling will be ignored/overwritten by [Upscale Period](#upscale-period).
- Can be paired with [upscale period](#upscale-period)
- Incompatible with [Downtime](#downtime) and [Uptime](#uptime)
- [Grouped](ref:docs-scopes#value-groups) with [downtime](#downtime),
  [uptime](#uptime) and [upscale period](#upscale-period)

## Downtime

- Type: [Timespans](ref:docs-timespans)
- Default: []
- Within these periods the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) will be scaled down.
  Outside of the periods the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) will be scaled up.
- Incompatible with [downscale period](#downscale-period), [upscale period](#upscale-period) and [Uptime](#uptime)
- [Grouped](ref:docs-scopes#value-groups) with [downscale period](#downscale-period),
  [uptime](#uptime) and [upscale period](#upscale-period)

## Upscale Period

- Type: [Timespans](ref:docs-timespans)
- Default: []
- Within these periods the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) will be scaled up.
  Outside of the periods, scaling will be ignored/overwritten by [Downscale Period](#downscale-period).
- Can be paired with [downscale period](#downscale-period)
- Incompatible with [Downtime](#downtime) and [Uptime](#uptime)
- [Grouped](ref:docs-scopes#value-groups) with [downscale period](#downscale-period),
  [uptime](#uptime) and [Downtime](#downtime)

## Uptime

- Type: [Timespans](ref:docs-timespans)
- Default: []
- Within these periods the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) will be scaled up.
  Outside of the periods the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) will be scaled down.
- Incompatible with [downscale period](#downscale-period), [upscale period](#upscale-period) and [Downtime](#downtime)
- [Grouped](ref:docs-scopes#value-groups) with [downscale period](#downscale-period),
  [upscale period](#upscale-period) and [Downtime](#downtime)

## Exclude

- Type: [Timespans](ref:docs-timespans) (this also includes [true/false](ref:docs-timespans#alwaysnevertruefalse))
- Default: false
- Excludes the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) from being scaled. (Scaling is ignored)

## Exclude Until

- Type: [RFC3339 timestamp](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339)
- Default: none
- Excludes the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) from being scaled until the set time. (Scaling is ignored)

## Force Uptime

- Type: [Timespans](ref:docs-timespans) (this also includes [true/false](ref:docs-timespans#alwaysnevertruefalse))
- Default: false
- Forces the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) into an uptime state. (Scaling up)
- Incompatible with [force downtime](#force-downtime)
- [Grouped](ref:docs-scopes#value-groups) with [force downtime](#force-downtime)

## Force Downtime

- Type: [Timespans](ref:docs-timespans) (this also includes [true/false](ref:docs-timespans#alwaysnevertruefalse))
- Default: false
- Forces the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) into a downtime state. (Scaling down)
- Incompatible with [force uptime](#force-uptime)
- [Grouped](ref:docs-scopes#value-groups) with [force uptime](#force-uptime)

## Downscale Replicas

- Type: [Integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer)
- Default: 0
- The Replica count the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) will be scaled to during downtimes.

## Grace Period

- Type: [Duration](ref:docs-duration)
- Default: 15 minutes
- The Duration a workload has to exist for until being scaled the first time.
  Will check against the timestamp in the [time annotation](ref:docs-runtime-configuration#time-annotation)
  instead of the creation time when set.
