# Downscaler Concepts

This section covers the main documentation of the Downscaler.
The following pages will go in depth on the following topics:

- [Scopes And Scaling](ref:docs-scopes-and-scaling): How the Downscaler works and how it can be used to scale workloads
- [Workload Types](ref:docs-workload-types): List all the workload types supported by the Downscaler
  and explain how they are scaled
- [Configurations](ref:docs-configurations): List all the configurations available at any scope for the Downscaler
- [Types](ref:docs-types): List and explain the custom types used by the Downscaler (e.g. Timespans, Durations, etc.)
- [Metrics](ref:docs-metrics): Explain all the metrics exposed by the Downscaler and how they can be used to monitor the Downscaler's activity

Once you are familiar with the basic concepts of the Downscaler, you can move on to the
[Helm Chart documentation section](ref:docs-helm) to learn how you can apply the concepts you learned to create a basic
installation setup.
