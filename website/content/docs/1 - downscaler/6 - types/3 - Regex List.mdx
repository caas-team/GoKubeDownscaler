# Regex List

A regex list is a list of [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression).

The regex flavor used is [Golang](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax#hdr-Syntax).

## Syntax

```text
<regex>,<regex>,<regex>,<regex>
```

or

```text
<regex>, <regex>, <regex>, <regex>
```

## Regex Evaluation

The regular expressions do have to match the whole string.
For example if you want to match `my-namespace` and `namespace1`
you can't just do a regex like `namespace` which then looks for the part `namespace` in the string.
What you would have to do is use the regex `.*namespace.*` to do so.

You can think of this like always having a start of string (`^`) and an end of string (`$`) anchor around your expression.
This means that the example expression would look like `^.*namespace.*$`.

If you want you can also put the start of string and end of string anchors around your expression yourself.
This doesn't change how the expression is evaluated.

## Spaces at Ends of Expression

You can't just have spaces at the start and end of your expression, since they will get trimmed.

If you still need to do so I would suggest to wrap your expression in a start of string (`^`) and end of string (`$`) anchor.
This stops the spaces from getting trimmed.
