# Workload Scope

The **Workload Scope** is the fifth scope available and holds configurations set at workload level.
It overrides values already defined inside the
[Default Scope](ref:docs-default-scope), [ENV Scope](ref:docs-env-scope), [CLI Scope](ref:docs-cli-scope)
and [Namespace Scope](ref:docs-namespace-scope).
It is the most specific scope available and its values can't be overridden by other scopes.
It is used to only set values

## Usage

The workload annotations can be set either directly through the workload YAML file (e.g. `kubectl edit` command)

```yaml title="example-deployment.yaml"
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: example-deployment
  # highlight-start
  annotations:
    downscaler/uptime: "Mon-Fri 08:00-20:00 UTC"
  # highlight-end
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: example-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: example-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: example-app-container
          image: nginx:latest
```

or by using the `kubectl annotate` command

```bash
kubectl annotate deployment example-deployment downscaler/uptime="Mon-Fri 08:00-20:00 UTC"
```
