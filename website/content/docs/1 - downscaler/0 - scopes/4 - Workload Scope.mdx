# Workload Scope

The **Workload Scope** is the fifth scope available and holds configurations set at workload level.
It overrides values already defined inside the
[Default Scope](ref:docs-default-scope), [ENV Scope](ref:docs-env-scope), [CLI Scope](ref:docs-cli-scope)
and [Namespace Scope](ref:docs-namespace-scope).
It is the most specific scope available and its values can't be overridden by other scopes.
It is only used to set values

## Values

At the Workload Scope, the following [values](ref:docs-values) can be configured using annotations to apply
scaling policies, exclusions and grace periods

- [downscaler/downscale-period](ref:docs-values#downscale-period)
- [downscaler/downtime](ref:docs-values#downtime)
- [downscaler/upscale-period](ref:docs-values#upscale-period)
- [downscaler/uptime](ref:docs-values#uptime)
- [downscaler/exclude](ref:docs-values#exclude)
- [downscaler/exclude-until](ref:docs-values#exclude-until)
- [downscaler/force-uptime](ref:docs-values#force-uptime)
- [downscaler/force-downtime](ref:docs-values#force-downtime)
- [downscaler/downscale-replicas](ref:docs-values#downscale-replicas)
- [downscaler/grace-period](ref:docs-values#grace-period)
- [downscaler/scale-children](ref:docs-values#scale-children)

:::warning

Some annotations are incompatible with others.
You can check their compatibility by viewing the dedicated documentation page from the list above.

## Usage

The workload annotations can be set either directly through the workload YAML file (e.g. `kubectl edit` command)

```yaml title="example-deployment.yaml"
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: example-deployment
  # highlight-start
  annotations:
    downscaler/uptime: "Mon-Fri 08:00-20:00 UTC"
  # highlight-end
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: example-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: example-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: example-app-container
          image: nginx:latest
```

or by using the `kubectl annotate` command

```bash
kubectl annotate deployment example-deployment downscaler/uptime="Mon-Fri 08:00-20:00 UTC"
```
