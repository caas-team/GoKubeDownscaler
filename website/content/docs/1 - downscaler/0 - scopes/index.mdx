# Scopes And Scaling

## Scopes

Scopes are levels that hold behavioral and scaling configurations.
These configurations can be divided into two categories:

- **Runtime Configurations:** define how the Downscaler itself operates, controlling aspects like which namespaces and
  workload types it should target, frequency of scans, retries, whether debugging information is enabled and more.
  Runtime Configurations do not dictate how and when individual workloads are scaled.
- **Values:** define the scaling behavior of targeted workloads,
  specifying how and when they should be scaled up or down.

### Available Scopes

The scopes are organized in a hierarchy, with each scope having its own set of configurations.
The available scopes are:

- [Default Scope](ref:docs-default-scope): contains only the default values.
- [Env Scope](ref:docs-env-scope): contains the values and runtime configurations set by the environment variables.
- [CLI Scope](ref:docs-cli-scope): contains the values and runtime configurations set by the CLI arguments.
- [Namespace Scope](ref:docs-namespace-scope): contains only the values set by the annotations on the namespace.
- [Workload Scope](ref:docs-workload-scope): contains only the values set by the annotations on the workload.

The hierarchy of scopes is important because it determines which configurations take precedence
when a particular configuration is defined in multiple scopes.
It can be visualized as pyramid, with the Default Scope at the bottom and the Workload Scope at the top.
Each scope can override the configurations of the scopes below it in the hierarchy.

## Scaling Algorithm

The scaling algorithm uses the values set in the scopes to determine how and when to scale workloads.
The resulting value is always the one set by the most specific scope that has set that value.

This means, as specified before, that [Workload Scope](ref:docs-workload-scope) > [Namespace Scope](ref:docs-namespace-scope) >
[CLI Scope](ref:docs-cli-scope) > [ENV Scope](ref:docs-env-scope) > [Default Scope](ref:docs-default-scope).

When computing scopes, exclusion values always take precedence, meaning that: no matter what the scaling values are
across any other scope, if a scope contains an exclusion the result will be an exclusion.

The diagram below illustrates how scaling is determined for a workload:

Cells ending with:

- × are not taken into account
- « are the cell the value was taken from
- ↑ are empty and are not taken into account

|             | Exclude | Downtime       | Replicas |
| ----------- | ------- | -------------- | -------- |
| Default     | false × | - ×            | 0 «      |
| Environment | - ×     | Mon-Fri 8-20 × | - ↑      |
| CLI         | - ×     | - ×            | - ↑      |
| Namespace   | true «  | - ×            | - ↑      |
| Workload    | - ↑     | Sat-Sun 0-24 « | - ↑      |
| Result      | true    | Sat-Sun 0-24   | 0        |

:::note[Reading the Diagram]

In the diagram above the downtime period is taken from the workload scope, however the resource will be excluded
since the namespace Scope has the exclude value set to true.

### Admission Algorithm

The admission algorithm is an optional feature of the GoKubeDownscaler that allows it to determine whether a workload should be downscaled
straight-away when it is created or updated.

When the admission algorithm is enabled, a MutatingWebhookConfiguration intercepts the creation and update of every targeted workload
deployed (or updated) in the cluster.
It then reviews the workload and determines whether it should be downscaled immediately based on the exact same scaling
algorithm described in the main section above.
If the workload is set to be downscaled, the admission algorithm will apply the scaling decisions
immediately, without waiting for the main GoKubeDownscaler deployment to run its cycle.

This feature avoids triggering unnecessary node provisioning and deprovisioning when all the cluster is already downscaled, allowing to
save extra resources and costs.
It is also useful in a Platform-based environment where the organization wants to ensure that all targeted
workloads are immediately compliant with the scaling policies defined by the organization

:::info[Enabling the Admission Algorithm]

The admission algorithm can be enabled by setting the `admissionController.enabled` value to `true` in the [Helm Chart](ref:docs-helm-admission-controller-enabled)
