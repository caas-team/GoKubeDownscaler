# Default Scope

The **Default Scope** is the most generic scope available.
It contains the default values for all the configuration options which are valid when no other scope is specified.
It can be overridden by the [ENV Scope](ref:docs-env-scope), [CLI Scope](ref:docs-cli-scope),
[Namespace Scope](ref:docs-namespace-scope) or [Workload Scope](ref:docs-workload-scope)

It is important to understand its default values since they will be used if no
other scope is specified.

## Values

The Default Values can be found in the [values page](ref:docs-values).
