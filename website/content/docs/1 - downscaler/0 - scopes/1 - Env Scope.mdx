# Env Scope

The **Env Scope** is the second type of scope available.
It overrides the [Default Scope](ref:docs-default-scope), but it can be overridden by the [CLI Scope](ref:docs-cli-scope),
[Namespace Scope](ref:docs-namespace-scope) or [Workload Scope](ref:docs-workload-scope)
It is used to set values and runtime configurations

<HierarchyDiagram highlight="b" />

## Values

At the environment scope, the following environment variable [values](ref:docs-values)
can be configured to apply global scaling policies across targeted resources.
These global settings can be overridden by more specific scopes in the hierarchy.

- [DOWNSCALE_PERIOD](ref:docs-values#downscale-period)
- [DEFAULT_DOWNTIME](ref:docs-values#downtime)
- [UPSCALE_PERIOD](ref:docs-values#upscale-period)
- [DEFAULT_UPTIME](ref:docs-values#uptime)

## Runtime Configuration

At the environment scope, the following environment variable [runtime configurations](ref:docs-runtime-configuration) are used to
control which namespaces or workloads should be excluded from scaling policies.

- [EXCLUDE_NAMESPACES](ref:docs-runtime-configuration#exclude-namespaces)
- [EXCLUDE_DEPLOYMENTS](ref:docs-runtime-configuration#exclude-deployments)

:::note

The runtime configuration set at the [CLI Scope](ref:docs-cli-scope#values)
will take precedence over their respective environment variables if they are both set.

:::

:::info

`EXCLUDE_DEPLOYMENTS`, despite its name, is not limited to target deployments.
This variable can be used to exclude any workload type

:::

## Usage

The Env Scope can be set in different ways, depending on your setup.
You can find some examples below

### Via Helm Chart values.yaml

You can set the Env Scope in the Helm Chart by using the `configMap.extraConfig` field.

```yaml title="values.yaml"
# ...

configMap:
  name: go-kube-downscaler
  extraConfig: |
    DEFAULT_DOWNTIME: "Mon-Fri 20:00-08:00 Asia/Tokyo, Sat-Sun 00:00-24:00 Asia/Tokyo"
    EXCLUDE_NAMESPACES: "my-namespace, example-.*"
    EXCLUDE_DEPLOYMENTS: "my-deployment"

# ...
```

:::warning

By default these config changes apply automatically.

However, if you set [forceRestartOnConfigChange](ref:docs-helm-force-restart-on-config-change) to false,
you will need to restart the Downscaler pods manually.

:::

### Via ConfigMap

If you are not working directly with Helm but rather with a raw Kubernetes manifest generated using the Helm Template
command, you can set the Env Scope inside the used ConfigMap

```yaml title="ConfigMap"
apiVersion: v1
data:
  DEFAULT_UPTIME: "Mon-Fri 10:00-19:00 Europe/Rome"
  EXCLUDE_NAMESPACES: "kube-downscaler,kube-system,default"
  EXCLUDE_DEPLOYMENTS: "my-deployment"
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: go-kube-downscaler
  namespace: go-kube-downscaler
```

:::warning

After the first installation, each time you want to change the ConfigMaps environment variables you need to restart the
Downscaler pods, otherwise the changes will not be applied.

:::

### Binary or Go Run

If you are using the Downscaler outside a Kubernetes cluster, environment variables can be written in a `.env` file
and then applied to the environment variables of the current shell by running the command `dotenv`

```text title=".env"
DEFAULT_UPTIME: "Mon-Fri 08:00-20:00 Pacific/Fiji"
EXCLUDE_DEPLOYMENTS: "my-deployment, example-.*"
```
