# Scopes

Scopes hold configuration [values](ref:docs-values) which influence scaling.
They define a uniform way of how to select which of the values gets used.

## How It Works

The resulting value is always the one set by the most specific scope that has set that value.

This means [Workload Scope](#workload-scope) > [Namespace Scope](#namespace-scope) >
[CLI Scope](#cli-scope) > [ENV Scope](#environment-scope) > [Default Scope](#default-scope).

### Value Groups

Some [values](ref:docs-values) within in a scope set/define very similar properties (e.g. [Force Downtime](ref:docs-values#force-downtime)
and [Force Uptime](ref:docs-values#force-uptime); [Downscale Period](ref:docs-values#downscale-period),
[Downtime](ref:docs-values#downtime), [Upscale Period](ref:docs-values#upscale-period) and [Uptime](ref:docs-values#uptime))

These values are not all handled separately when choosing which scope to take the values from.
Instead if one of them is set in a scope, the other values will be taken from the same scope.

Incompatibilities between values normally only occur between values in the same value group and therefore the values on that same scope.

## Workload Scope

Defined by the [annotations](ref:docs-values) on the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) every scan.

The most specific scope.
If a value gets set here it will be used for scaling.

## Namespace Scope

Defined by the [annotations](ref:docs-values) on the namespace every scan.

Values set here can be overwritten by the [workload scope](#workload-scope)

## CLI Scope

Defined by the [cli arguments](ref:docs-arguments) at startup.

Values set here can be overwritten by the [namespace](#namespace-scope) and [workload scope](#workload-scope)

## Environment Scope

Defined by the [environment variables](ref:docs-environment-variables) at startup.

Values set here can be overwritten by the [cli](#cli-scope), the [namespace](#namespace-scope) and [workload scope](#workload-scope).

:::info

With the current setup it is not possible to update these values every scan,
as the value of config maps is only passed in at creation of the deployment.

:::

## Default Scope

Holds the defaults for all [values](ref:docs-values).

Values set here can be overwritten by all other scopes.
