# Workload Types

Valid values for the workload type are the case-insensitive kubernetes resource names of the workloads.

## Cronjobs

- id: cronjobs
- resource: cronjob.v1.batch

Scales by setting the cronjobs suspend property to true, which halts further scheduled runs of the Cronjob.

## Daemonsets

- id: daemonsets
- resource: daemonset.v1.apps

Scales by setting the node selector to match none of the nodes, which stops pods from running on any node.

## Deployments

- id: deployments
- resource: deployment.v1.apps

Scales by setting the replica count to the [downscale replicas](ref:docs-values#downscale-replicas).

## HPAs

- id: horizontalpodautoscalers
- resource: horizontalpodautoscaler.v2.autoscaling

Scales by setting the minReplicas to the [downscale replicas](ref:docs-values#downscale-replicas).
If the [downscale replicas](ref:docs-values#downscale-replicas) are less than 1 it will throw an error.

## Jobs

- id: jobs
- resource: job.v1.batch

Scales by setting the suspend property to true, which stops the execution of the job until it is upscaled again.

## PodDisruptionBudgets

- id: poddisruptionbudgets
- resource: poddisruptionbudget.v1.policy

Scales by setting the maxUnavailable or minAvailable properties (depending on which one is used) to the [downscale replicas](ref:docs-values#downscale-replicas).
If minAvailable or maxUnavailable are percentiles instead of replica counts, scaling will be skipped.

## ScaledObjects

- id: scaledobjects
- resource: scaledobject.v1alpha1.keda.sh

Scales by setting the paused replicas annotation to the [downscale replicas](ref:docs-values#downscale-replicas),
which scales the workloads managed by the scaled object to the [downscale replicas](ref:docs-values#downscale-replicas).

## Statefulsets

- id: statefulsets
- resource: statefulset.v1.apps

Scales by setting the replica count to the [downscale replicas](ref:docs-values#downscale-replicas).

## Rollouts

- id: Rollouts
- resource: rollout.v1alpha1.argoproj.io

Scales by setting the replica count to the [downscale replicas](ref:docs-values#downscale-replicas).

## Stacks

- id: stacks
- resource: stack.v1.zalando.org

Scales by setting the replica count to the [downscale replicas](ref:docs-values#downscale-replicas).

## Prometheuses

- id: prometheuses
- resource: prometheus.v1.monitoring.coreos.com

Scales by setting the replica count to the [downscale replicas](ref:docs-values#downscale-replicas).
