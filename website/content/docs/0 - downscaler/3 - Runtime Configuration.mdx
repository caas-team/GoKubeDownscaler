# Runtime Configuration

Runtime Configurations change how the Downscaler operates.

## Dry Run

- Type: boolean
- Description: Makes the downscaler print the changes it would have made instead of applying them.
  Will additionally enable [Debug](#debug).
- Default: false

## Debug

- Type: boolean
- Description: Will print additional debug information.
- Default: false

## Once

- Type: boolean
- Description: Makes the Downscaler only scan once before exiting.
- Default: false

## Interval

- Type: [Duration](ref:docs-duration)
- Description: Sets the time the Downscaler waits between scans.
- Default: 30s

## Namespace

- Type: [String List](ref:docs-string-list) (list of namespace names)
- Description: Sets the namespaces the Downscaler will scan over.
- Default: All Namespaces

## Include Resources

- Type: [String List](ref:docs-string-list) (list of [workload types](ref:docs-workload-types))
- Description: Sets the resources/workload types the downscaler will scan over.
- Default: `deployments`

## Exclude Namespaces

- Type: [Regex List](ref:docs-regex-list) (list of regex patterns matching namespace names)
- Description: Makes the downscaler exclude workloads within matching namespaces.
- Default: `kube-system`, `kube-downscaler`

## Exclude Deployments

- Type: [Regex List](ref:docs-regex-list) (list of regex patterns matching workload names)
- Description: Makes the downscaler exclude matching workloads.
- Default: none

## Matching Labels

- Type: [Regex List](ref:docs-regex-list) (list of regex patterns matching labels)
  :::info

  The Pattern has to match this pattern: `LABEL_NAME=LABEL_VALUE`.
  This means that to match the `example` label to be `"true"` you would put in `example=true`.
  To match a workload having the label no matter the value you would use `example=.*`.

  :::

- Description: Makes the downscaler only scale workloads whose labels match at least one of the patterns.
- Default: none (the workloads don't have to match any label)

## Time Annotation

- Type: string (annotation on workload containing an [RFC3339 formatted timestamp](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339))
- Description: Makes the downscaler check the [grace period](ref:docs-values#grace-period) against the value of the annotation
  instead of the creation time of the workload.
- Default: none (the downscaler will use the creation time of the workload)

## Leader Election

- Type: boolean
- Description: Enforces leader election by creating [lease objects](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/leases/)
  to ensure only one instance of the GoKubeDownscaler is active at any given time to avoid conflicts.
- Default: false

## Max Retries on Conflict

- Type: integer
- Description: Sets the maximum number of retries for handling HTTP 409 conflict errors,
  which occur when another entity modifies a resource that the downscaler is currently processing.
- Default: 0

## Kubeconfig

- Type: string (path to a kubeconfig file)
- Description: Makes the downscaler use the local kubeconfig instead of using the in-cluster config.
  It will use the `current-context` specified in the kubeconfig.
  The token/account used by the kubeconfig needs to have the [permissions necessary for scaling](ref:docs-helm-permissions).
- Default: none (the downscaler will use the in-cluster config)
