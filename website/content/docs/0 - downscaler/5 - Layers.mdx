# Layers

Layers are layers of [values](ref:docs-values).
They define a uniform way of how to select which of the values gets used.

## How it Works

The resulting value is always the one set by the most specific layer.
This means Workload Layer > Namespace Layer > CLI Layer > ENV Layer.

## Workload Layer

Defined by the [annotations](ref:docs-values) on the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) every scan.

The most specific layer. if a value gets set here it will be used for scaling.

## Namespace Layer

Defined by the [annotations](ref:docs-values) on the namespace every scan.

Values set here can be overwritten by the [workload layer](#workload)

## CLI Layer

Defined by the [cli arguments](ref:docs-arguments) at startup.

Values set here can be overwritten by the [namespace](#namespace) and [workload layer](#workload)

## Environment Layer

Defined by the [environment variables](ref:docs-environment-variables) at startup.

Values set here can be overwritten by all other layers.

:::info
With the current setup it is not possible to update these values every scan, as the value of config maps is only passed in at creation of the deployment.
