# Timespans

Timespans define periods of time.

There are three types of timespans:

- [Absolute timespans](#absolute-timespans): a timespan defined by two absolute points in time
- [Relative timespans](#relative-timespans): reoccurring on a weekly schedule
- [Boolean timespans](#alwaysnevertruefalse): statically always or never active

## Absolute Timespans

- Format:
  `<RFC3339-Timestamp>-<RFC3339-Timestamp>` or
  `<RFC3339-Timestamp> - <RFC3339-Timestamp>`
- Example: `2024-07-29T08:30:00Z - 2024-07-29T16:00:00+02:00`

See [RFC3339 Timestamps](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) for more information

## Relative Timespans

- Format: `<Weekday-From>-<Weekday-To> <Time-Of-Day-From>-<Time-Of-Day-To> <Timezone>`
- Examples:

  ```text
  Mon-Fri 08:00-20:00 Asia/Tokyo          # From Monday to Friday: from 08:00 to 20:00
  Sat-Sun 00:00-24:00 UTC                 # On The Weekend: the entire day
  Mon-Fri 20:00-08:00 Australia/Sydney    # From Monday to Friday: from Midnight to 08:00 and from 20:00 until end of day
  Mon-Sun 00:00-00:00 America/New_York    # The timespan never matches, this would not do anything
  Mon-Tue 20:00-24:00 Africa/Johannesburg # On Monday and Tuesday: from 20:00 to midnight
  Mon-Tue 20:00-00:00 Europe/Amsterdam    # On Monday and Tuesday: from 20:00 to midnight
  ```

You can reverse the times (example: `20:00-08:00`).
This makes the timespan match the time from start of day until 08:00 and from 20:00 until the end of day.

### Valid Values

#### Weekdays

Case-insensitive:

- Mon
- Tue
- Wed
- Thu
- Fri
- Sat
- Sun

#### Timezones

The timezones are from the [IANA Time Zone database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones).

:::note

The IANA Time Zone database mainly supports regional/city timezones
(example: `Europe/Berlin`, `America/Los_Angeles`) instead of abbreviations (example: `CEST`, `PST`, `PDT`).
It supports some abbreviations like `CET`, `MET` and `PST8PDT`
but these (not including `UTC`) shouldn't be used, and only exist for backwards compatibility.

:::

#### Time of Day

Values from: 00:00 - 24:00

## Always/Never/True/False

Case-insensitive:

- Always/True: always matches
- Never/False: never matches, acts as a [non-unset state](ref:docs-scopes#how-it-works)

:::tip

Never/False and other non-unset states can be useful for disabling the value if set by less specific scopes.

:::

## Complex Timespans

Sometimes its not enough to have just one timespan, in those cases you can define multiple.

- Syntax:
  `<TIMESPAN>,<TIMESPAN>,<TIMESPAN>` or
  `<TIMESPAN>, <TIMESPAN>, <TIMESPAN>`
- Example:
  `Sat-Sun 00:00-24:00 Europe/Berlin, Mon-Fri 20:00-08:00 Europe/Berlin` -
  This expression matches the time over the weekend and at night.

You can mix any type of timespan.

:::note

Although you could mix [boolean timespans](#alwaysnevertruefalse) with the other ones,
this is not a valid use case and might be changed to a compatibility conflict in the future.
