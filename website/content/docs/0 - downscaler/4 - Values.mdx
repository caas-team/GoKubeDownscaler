# Values

Values are configuration values which decide scaling parameters.
They can be set at any [layer](ref:docs-layers) and therefore can be set via their respective
[environment variables](ref:docs-environment-variables), [cli arguments](ref:docs-arguments), [namespace annotations and workload annotations](ref:docs-annotations)

:::note

The default values shown below are only set on [the default layer](ref:docs-layers#default-layer).

:::

## Downscale Period

- Type: [Timespans](ref:docs-timespans)
- Default: []
- Within these periods the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) will be scaled down.
  Outside of the periods, scaling will be ignored.
- Can be paired with [upscale period](#upscale-period)
- Incompatible with [Downtime](#downtime) and [Uptime](#uptime)

## Downtime

- Type: [Timespans](ref:docs-timespans)
- Default: []
- Within these periods the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) will be scaled down.
  Outside of the periods the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) will be scaled up.
- Incompatible with [downscale period](#downscale-period), [upscale period](#upscale-period) and [Uptime](#uptime)

## Upscale Period

- Type: [Timespans](ref:docs-timespans)
- Default: []
- Within these periods the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) will be scaled up.
  Outside of the periods, scaling will be ignored.
- Can be paired with [downscale period](#downscale-period)
- Incompatible with [Downtime](#downtime) and [Uptime](#uptime)

## Uptime

- Type: [Timespans](ref:docs-timespans)
- Default: []
- Within these periods the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) will be scaled up.
  Outside of the periods the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) will be scaled down.
- Incompatible with [downscale period](#downscale-period), [upscale period](#upscale-period) and [Downtime](#downtime)

## Exclude

- Type: [Boolean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type)
- Default: false
- Excludes the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) from being scaled. (Scaling is ignored)

## Exclude Until

- Type: [RFC3339 timestamp](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339)
- Default: none
- Excludes the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) from being scaled until the set time. (Scaling is ignored)

## Force Uptime

- Type: [Boolean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type)
- Default: false
- Forces the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) into an uptime state. (Scaling up)
- Incompatible with [force downtime](#force-downtime)

## Force Downtime

- Type: [Boolean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type)
- Default: false
- Forces the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) into a downtime state. (Scaling down)
- Incompatible with [force uptime](#force-uptime)

## Downscale Replicas

- Type: [Integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer)
- Default: 0
- The Replica count the [workload](ref:docs-workload-types) will be scaled to during downtimes.

## Grace Period

- Type: [Duration](ref:docs-duration)
- Default: 15 minutes
- The Duration a workload has to exist for until being scaled the first time.
  Will check against the timestamp in the [time annotation](ref:docs-runtime-configuration#time-annotation)
  instead of the creation time when set.
