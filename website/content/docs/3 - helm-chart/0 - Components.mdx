# Helm Chart Components

The following Kubernetes Objects can be created with our Helm Chart:

## Deployment

The [deployment.yaml](repo:deployments/chart/templates/deployment.yaml) file creates the main Deployment of the GoKubeDownscaler
with a reference to the provided ServiceAccount and ConfigMap.

## Serviceaccount

The [serviceaccount.yaml](repo:deployments/chart/templates/serviceaccount.yaml) file creates a ServiceAccount
that will be used by the GoKubeDownscaler to interact with Kubernetes.

## Configmap

The [configmap.yaml](repo:deployments/chart/templates/configmap.yaml) file creates a new ConfigMap with the provided name.
It is used to store environment variables like `EXCLUDE_NAMESPACES`.

## Clusterrole

The [clusterrole.yaml](repo:deployments/chart/templates/clusterrole.yaml) file creates a ClusterRole and a ClusterRoleBinding
for the desired cluster if there are no namespaces defined in [`constrainedNamespaces`](ref:docs-helm-constrained-namespaces).
These allow the actions the GoKubeDownscaler needs to scale down workloads in a cluster-wide context.

## Role

The [role.yaml](repo:deployments/chart/templates/role.yaml) file creates a Role and a RoleBinding
for every namespace listed in [`constrainedNamespaces`](ref:docs-helm-constrained-namespaces).

## Leaserole

The [leaserole.yaml](repo:deployments/chart/templates/leaserole.yaml) file creates a Role and RoleBinding
if [`--leader-election`](ref:docs-runtime-configuration#leader-election) is enabled in order to make lease management possible.

## Webhookdeployment

The [webhookdeployment.yaml](repo:deployments/chart/templates/webhookdeployment.yaml) file creates the Deployment
for the Admission Controller Webhook.
This resource is created only if the `webhook.enabled` value is set to `true`.

## Webhookservice

The [webhookservice.yaml](repo:deployments/chart/templates/webhookservice.yaml) file creates the Service that exposes
the Webhook Deployment.
This resource is created only if the `webhook.enabled` value is set to `true`.

## Webhookrole

The [webhookrole.yaml](repo:deployments/chart/templates/webhookrole.yaml) file creates a Role and RoleBinding that
allows the Webhook Deployment to only read the Webhook secret

## Mutatingwebhookconfiguration

The [mutatingwebhookconfiguration.yaml](repo:deployments/chart/templates/mutatingwebhookconfiguration.yaml) file creates
the MutatingWebhookConfiguration needed for the Admission Controller Webhook to work.
By default, it intercepts all the
creation and update requests for the targeted resources and send the review request to the Webhook Deployment through
its Service in a secure way.
The MutatingWebhookConfiguration does not apply for the namespace where the Webhook
is deployed and from requests originated by the main Deployment of the GoKubeDownscaler.

## PodMonitor

The [podmonitor.yaml](repo:deployments/chart/templates/leaserole.yaml) file creates a PodMonitor that is able to scrape
metrics from GoKubeDownscaler main deployment
