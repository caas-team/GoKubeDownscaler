# Permissions

The GoKubeDownscaler needs certain permissions to scale workloads.

If there are namespaces defined in [`constrainedNamespaces`](ref:docs-helm-constrained-namespaces)
the Helm Chart will create roles for each listed namespace.

Otherwise it will always create a cluster role with the needed permissions.

## Default Permissions

By default the GoKubeDownscaler will always have the following permissions if it is installed via our Helm Chart:

```yaml
- apiGroups:
    - ""
  resources:
    - namespaces
  verbs:
    - get
- apiGroups:
    - ""
  resources:
    - events
  verbs:
    - get
    - create
    - update
```

These are necessary for the GoKubeDownscaler to work properly.

## Workload Permissions

The Helm Chart assigns `get`, `list` and `update` permissions for the workloads defined in [`includedResources`](ref:docs-helm-included-resources).

These resources can be:

- Deployments
- Statefulsets
- Daemonsets
- Rollouts
- HorizontalPodAutoscalers
- Jobs
- Cronjobs
- ScaledObjects
- Stacks
- PodDisruptionBudgets
- Prometheuses
- AutoscalingRunnerSets
