# HealthProbes

The `healthProbes` section defines how some of the health probes properties should be set.

:::info

The default value of healthProbes is:

```yaml
healthProbes:
  readinessProbe:
    enabled: true
    failureThreshold: 3
    initialDelaySeconds: 5
    periodSeconds: 3
    timeoutSeconds: 2
    successThreshold: 1

  livenessProbe:
    enabled: true
    failureThreshold: 3
    initialDelaySeconds: 5
    periodSeconds: 3
    timeoutSeconds: 2
    successThreshold: 1

  startupProbe:
    enabled: true
    failureThreshold: 3
    initialDelaySeconds:
    periodSeconds: 3
    timeoutSeconds: 2
    successThreshold: 1
```

:::

The basic fields that can be set are:

- `healthProbes.readinessProbe.enabled`: Enables or disables the readiness probe for the GoKubeDownscaler.
  When enabled, Kubernetes checks if the GoKubeDownscaler is ready to serve traffic.
- `healthProbes.readinessProbe.failureThreshold`: The number of consecutive probe failures that must occur before the
  GoKubeDownscaler is considered unready.
- `healthProbes.readinessProbe.initialDelaySeconds`: The number of seconds after the container starts before the
  readiness probe is initiated.
- `healthProbes.readinessProbe.periodSeconds`: How often (in seconds) the readiness probe is performed.
- `healthProbes.readinessProbe.timeoutSeconds`: The number of seconds after which the readiness probe times out if no
  response is received.
- `healthProbes.readinessProbe.successThreshold`: The number of consecutive successful probes required
  for the GoKubeDownscaler to be considered ready

- `healthProbes.livenessProbe.enabled`: Enables or disables the liveness probe for the GoKubeDownscaler.
  When enabled, Kubernetes checks if the GoKubeDownscaler is still alive and functioning.
- `healthProbes.livenessProbe.failureThreshold`: The number of consecutive probe failures that must occur before the
  GoKubeDownscaler is considered unhealthy and restarted.
- `healthProbes.livenessProbe.initialDelaySeconds`: The number of seconds after the container starts before the liveness
  probe is initiated.
- `healthProbes.livenessProbe.periodSeconds`: How often (in seconds) the liveness probe is performed.
- `healthProbes.livenessProbe.timeoutSeconds`: The number of seconds after which the liveness probe times out if no
  response is received.
- `healthProbes.livenessProbe.successThreshold`: The number of consecutive successful probes required
  for the GoKubeDownscaler to be considered healthy

- `healthProbes.startupProbe.enabled`: Enables or disables the startup probe for the GoKubeDownscaler.
  When enabled, Kubernetes checks if the GoKubeDownscaler has started up successfully.
- `healthProbes.startupProbe.failureThreshold`: The number of consecutive probe failures that must
  occur before the GoKubeDownscaler is considered to have failed startup.
- `healthProbes.startupProbe.initialDelaySeconds`: The number of seconds after the container starts before the startup
  probe is initiated.
- `healthProbes.startupProbe.periodSeconds`: How often (in seconds) the startup probe is performed.
- `healthProbes.startupProbe.timeoutSeconds`: The number of seconds after which the startup probe times out if no response is received.
- `healthProbes.startupProbe.successThreshold`: The number of consecutive successful probes required for the GoKubeDownscaler to be
  considered to have started up successfully
