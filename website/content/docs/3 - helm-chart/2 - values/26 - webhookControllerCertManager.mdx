# webhookController.certManager

The `webhookController.certManager` defines all the value needed to configure cert-manager for the Webhook.

:::info

The default values for `webhookController.certManager` are:

```yaml
certManager:
  enabled: false
  duration: 8760h0m0s # 1 year
  renewBefore: 5840h0m0s # 8 months
  secretTemplate: {}
  ca:
    generate: true
    ecretName: "kubedownscaler-ca"
  issuer:
    generate: true
    name: foo-org-ca # Required when "issuer.generate: false"
    kind: ClusterIssuer # Required when "issuer.generate: false"
    group: cert-manager.io # Required when "issuer.generate: false"
```

:::

When `webhookController.certManager.enabled` is set to `true` the management of certificates is delegated to cert-manager.

The basic fields to configure cert-manager are:

- `webhookController.certManager.duration`: The duration that the certificate is valid for.
  Default is `8760h0m0s` (1 year).
- `webhookController.certManager.renewBefore`: The duration before the certificate expires that cert-manager will attempt to renew the
  certificate.
  Default is `5840h0m0s` (8 months).
- `webhookController.certManager.secretTemplate`: additional labels and annotations to the Secret created to store the certificate and
  key used by the Webhook.

The user can set `webhookController.certManager.ca.generate` to `true` or `false` to choose to have cert-manager create a self-signed CA
certificate to sign the certificate used by the Webhook or provide its own CA certificate.
If `false` the user must provide an existing Secret containing the CA certificate by setting the
`webhookController.certManager.ca.secretName` field, in this case the secret must be annotated with the
`cert-manager.io/allow-direct-injection: "true"` annotation

The user can set `webhookController.certManager.issuer.generate` to `true` or `false` to choose to have cert-manager create a self-signed
CA Issuer or ClusterIssuer to sign the certificate used by the Webhook or provide its own Issuer or ClusterIssuer.
