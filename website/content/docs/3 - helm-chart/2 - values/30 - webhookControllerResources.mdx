# webhookController.resources

The `webhookController.resources` value defines the CPU and memory limits and requests.

:::info

The default values for `webhookController.resources` are:

```yaml
webhookController:
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu: 2000m
      memory: 900Mi
    requests:
      cpu: 200m
      memory: 300Mi
```

:::

Here you can adjust the minimum and maximum amounts of cpu and memory the GoKubeDownscaler Pod is allowed to use.

The `requests` value being the minimum/reserved memory for the pod and the `limits` being the maximum the pod can use.

For more information on resource management you can reference [the official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers).
