# webhookController.healthProbes

The `webhookController.healthProbes` defines how some of the health probes properties should be set.

:::info

The default value of `webhookController.healthProbes` is:

```yaml
webhookController:
  healthProbes:
    readinessProbe:
      enabled: true
      failureThreshold: 3
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 3
      timeoutSeconds: 2
      successThreshold: 1

    livenessProbe:
      enabled: true
      failureThreshold: 3
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 3
      timeoutSeconds: 2
      successThreshold: 1

    startupProbe:
      enabled: true
      failureThreshold: 3
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 3
      timeoutSeconds: 2
      successThreshold: 1
```

:::

The basic fields that can be set are:

- `webhookController.healthProbes.readinessProbe.enabled`: Enables or disables the readiness probe for the GoKubeDownscaler Webhook.
  When enabled,Kubernetes checks if the GoKubeDownscaler Webhook is ready to serve traffic.
- `webhookController.healthProbes.readinessProbe.failureThreshold`: The number of consecutive probe failures that must occur before the
  GoKubeDownscaler Webhook is considered unready.
- `webhookController.healthProbes.readinessProbe.initialDelaySeconds`: The number of seconds after the container starts before the
  readiness probe is initiated.
- `webhookController.healthProbes.readinessProbe.periodSeconds`: How often (in seconds) the readiness probe is performed.
- `webhookController.healthProbes.readinessProbe.timeoutSeconds`: The number of seconds after which the readiness probe times out if no
  response is received.
- `webhookController.healthProbes.readinessProbe.successThreshold`: The number of consecutive successful probes required
  for the GoKubeDownscaler Webhook to be considered ready

- `webhookController.healthProbes.livenessProbe.enabled`: Enables or disables the liveness probe for the GoKubeDownscaler Webhook.
  When enabled, Kubernetes checks if the webhook is still alive and functioning.
- `webhookController.healthProbes.livenessProbe.failureThreshold`: The number of consecutive probe failures that must occur before the
  GoKubeDownscaler Webhook is considered unhealthy and restarted.
- `webhookController.healthProbes.livenessProbe.initialDelaySeconds`: The number of seconds after the container starts before the liveness
  probe is initiated.
- `webhookController.healthProbes.livenessProbe.periodSeconds`: How often (in seconds) the liveness probe is performed.
- `webhookController.healthProbes.livenessProbe.timeoutSeconds`: The number of seconds after which the liveness probe times out if no
  response is received.
- `webhookController.healthProbes.livenessProbe.successThreshold`: The number of consecutive successful probes required
  for the GoKubeDownscaler Webhook to be considered healthy

- `webhookController.healthProbes.startupProbe.enabled`: Enables or disables the startup probe for the GoKubeDownscaler Webhook.
  When enabled, Kubernetes checks if the GoKubeDownscaler Webhook has started up successfully.
- `webhookController.healthProbes.startupProbe.failureThreshold`: The number of consecutive probe failures that must
  occur before the GoKubeDownscaler Webhook is considered to have failed startup.
- `webhookController.healthProbes.startupProbe.initialDelaySeconds`: The number of seconds after the container starts before the startup
  probe is initiated.
- `webhookController.healthProbes.startupProbe.periodSeconds`: How often (in seconds) the startup probe is performed.
- `webhookController.healthProbes.startupProbe.timeoutSeconds`: The number of seconds after which the startup probe times out
  if no response is received.
- `webhookController.healthProbes.startupProbe.successThreshold`: The number of consecutive successful probes required for
  the GoKubeDownscaler Webhook to be considered to have started up successfully
