# Metrics

The `metrics` value of the chart

- `enabled` is a boolean value indicating if metrics should be enabled or not

:::info

The default values for `metrics` are:

```yaml
metrics:
  enabled: true
```

:::

By default the `metrics.enabled` value of the Helm Chart is set to false.
When set to true, the Helm Chart will create
a Service that exposes the GoKubeDownscaler metrics on port 8085.
To understand which metrics are exposed and how to use
them refer to the [metrics documentation](ref:docs-metrics).
Enabling metrics can impact the performance of the GoKubeDownscaler,
especially memory usage, so it is recommended to monitor the resource usage of the GoKubeDownscaler when enabling metrics,
especially in very large clusters.
