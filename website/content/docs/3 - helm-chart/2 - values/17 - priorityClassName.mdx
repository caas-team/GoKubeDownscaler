# priorityClassName

The `priorityClassName` value adds a priority class to the GoKubeDownscaler pods.

:::info

The default value for `priorityClassName` is:

```yaml
priorityClassName:
```

:::

This field allows the GoKubeDownscaler pods to be scheduled with a specific priority class.

If you want to allow the GoKubeDownscaler pods to schedule with a priority class named `high-priority` you can set:

```yaml
priorityClassName: "high-priority"
```

For more information on priority classes you can reference [the official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-priority-preemption/).
