# webhookController.enabled

The `webhookController.enabled` value defines whether the pods of the GoKubeDownscaler Webhook Deployment should be enabled or not.

:::info

The default values for `webhookController.enabled` are:

```yaml
webhookController:
  enabled: false
```

:::

The Webhook Deployment implements the same algorithm as the main GoKubeDownscaler deployment, but it is used to downscale straight-away the
target resources when they are deployed without waiting for the GoKubeDownscaler main deployment to run its cycle.
It is useful to avoid unnecessary node provisioning when the cluster is already downscaled and a new resource is deployed.
