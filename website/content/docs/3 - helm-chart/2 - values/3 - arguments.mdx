# Arguments

The `arguments` value allows you to set additional [cli arguments](ref:docs-cli-scope) at the startup of the container.

:::info

This field by default sets the same arguments for the main deployment and for the
[webhookController](ref:docs-helm-webhook-controller-enabled) (if the webhook is enabled).
By default, the two components are designed to share almost the same set of arguments.
However, it is possible to use `extraArguments` field and the `webhookController.extraArguments`
to provide arguments that apply only to one deployment, or add additional arguments on top of the
shared ones.
This flexibility makes it possible to configure the two components independently when
needed; incompatibilities between different arguments on the two deployments must be taken into account

:::info

By default the `arguments` field is empty.:

```yaml
arguments:
```

:::

Adding an argument will change how the GoKubeDownscaler behaves.

:::tip Example

```yaml
arguments:
  - --interval=10s
  - --dry-run=true
```

This configuration will set the GoKubeDownscaler to dry run mode,
which makes it only print the actions it would have performed instead of actually scaling resources.
Additionally, it sets the wait time between workload scans to 10 seconds.

You can find a list of all possible arguments in [the cli argument docs](ref:docs-cli-scope).
