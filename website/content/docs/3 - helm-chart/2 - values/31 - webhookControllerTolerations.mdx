# webhookController.tolerations

The `webhookController.tolerations` value adds tolerations to the pods of the deployment to be able to be scheduled on
nodes with matching taints.

:::info

The default value for `webhookController.tolerations` is:

```yaml
webhookController:
  tolerations: []
```

:::

This field allows the GoKubeDownscaler Webhook pods to be scheduled on Nodes with certain taints.

If you want to allow the GoKubeDownscaler Webhook pods to schedule on a Node with a taint `key1=value1:NoSchedule` you
can set:

```yaml
webhookController:
  tolerations:
    - key: "key1"
      operator: "Equal"
      value: "value1"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
```

For more information on taints and tolerations you can reference [the official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration).
