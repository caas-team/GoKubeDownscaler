# Workflows

This section covers documentation on all github workflows in the repository.

All workflows are in `./.github/workflows`.

## Auto Assign Author

This workflow automatically assigns the author of the PR as the assignee unless the assignees were otherwise specified.

File: `auto_assign_author.yaml`
Runs on: pull_request.opened, pull_request.reopened

## Check for Release

This workflow stops a pull request which when merged would result in a new release from being merged automatically.

The workflow checks if the app version or Helm chart version in the Chart.yaml changed.
This would result in a new release if the pull request were to be merged.

If merging the PR would result in a new release the <GithubLabel label="needs approval"/> label will be added to it.
Additionally a message warning about this and explaining the steps needed to merge will be sent in the pull request.

The pull request can not be merged until the <GithubLabel label="new release"/> label gets added to the PR.
After that the <GithubLabel label="needs approval"/> label will get removed automatically and the PR can be merged.

File: `check_for_release.yaml`
Runs on: pull_request.opened, pull_request.synchronize, pull_request.labeled, pull_request.unlabeled
