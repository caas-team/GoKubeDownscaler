# Helm Chart

In order to make the installation of the GoKubeDownscaler as easy as possible we provide a fully customizable Helm Chart.

The Helm Chart is available on [ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/py-kube-downscaler/go-kube-downscaler)
or can be taken from the release artifacts of the
[GoKubeDownscaler GitHub Repository](https://github.com/caas-team/GoKubeDownscaler).

The following pages will cover the most important things you might want to know about the Helm Chart:

- [Components](ref:docs-helm-components): Overview of the components that can be deployed with the Helm Chart
- [Permissions](ref:docs-helm-permissions): Overview of the permissions that will be set by the Helm Chart
- [Values](ref:docs-helm-values): Overview of the values available in the Helm Chart to customize the installation

A practical example of how to install the Helm Chart can be found in the
[Getting Started guide](ref:guides-installation).
