# admissionController.replicaCount

The `admissionController.replicaCount` value adjusts the number of replicas that the GoKubeDownscaler deployment will
have.

:::info

The default value of `admissionController.replicaCount` is:

```yaml
admissionController:
  replicaCount: 1
```

:::

Changing this to a different integer value will result in the deployment of the provided number of pods.
Using more
than one replica could be useful for high availability and to balance the load of incoming requests.
