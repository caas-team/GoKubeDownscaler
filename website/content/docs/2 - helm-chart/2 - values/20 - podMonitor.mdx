# podMonitor

A `PodMonitor` is a custom resource used by Prometheus Operator to discover and scrape metrics from Kubernetes pods.
It defines how Prometheus should find pods, which endpoints to scrape, and what labels or relabeling rules to apply.
The downscaler chart is able to automatically deploy a PodMonitor when requested

The following fields could be customized:

- `enable` indicates whether the PodMonitor resource should be created.
- `interval` specifies the scraping interval of the main deployment.
- `scrapeTimeout` specifies scrape timeout of the main deployment.
- `namespace` specifies the namespace where the PodMonitor is deployed (where Prometheus Operator is running).
- `additionalLabels` specifies xxtra labels to attach to the PodMonitor resource.
- `relabelings` specifies relabeling configs applied to target labels before scraping.
- `metricRelabelings` specifies relabeling configs applied to metrics after scraping.

:::info

The default values for `podMonitor` are:

```yaml
podMonitor:
  enabled: false
  interval: "1m"
  scrapeTimeout: "10s"
  namespace: ""
  additionalLabels: {}
  relabelings: []
  metricRelabelings: []
```
