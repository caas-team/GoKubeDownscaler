# admissionController.affinity

The `admissionController.affinity` value defines rules for node affinity and pod affinity/anti-affinity.

:::info

The default value for `admissionController.affinity` is:

```yaml
admissionController:
  affinity: {}
```

:::

By default the `admissionController.affinity` field is empty.

You can add affinity rules to this field that give you a few more options for pod scheduling than [`nodeSelector`](ref:docs-helm-node-selector).

## Node Affinity

You can use Node affinity to achieve something very similar to the [`nodeSelector`](ref:docs-helm-node-selector).

```yaml
admissionController:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
          - matchExpressions:
              - key: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
                operator: In
                values:
                  - antarctica-east1
                  - antarctica-west1
```

With the configuration above the GoKubeDownscaler will only be scheduled on a Node where the label `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` exists and
has either the value `antarctica-east1` or `antarctica-west1`.

## Pod Affinity

Pod affinity on the other hand will compare the labels of all **pods** on a Node.

```yaml
admissionController:
  affinity:
    podAntiAffinity:
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - labelSelector:
            matchExpressions:
              - key: env
                operator: In
                values:
                  - test
```

With this configuration the GoKubeDownscaler will only try to deploy the pods on a Node where no other pod has the label `env=test`.

For more information on affinity you can reference [the official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity).
