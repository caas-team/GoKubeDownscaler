# Arguments

The `arguments` value allows you to set additional [cli arguments](ref:docs-arguments) at the startup of the container.

:::info

By default the `arguments` field is empty.:

```yaml
arguments:
```

:::

Adding an argument will change how the GoKubeDownscaler behaves.

:::tip Example

```yaml
arguments:
  - --interval=10s
  - --dry-run=true
```

This configuration will set the GoKubeDownscaler to dry run mode,
which makes it only print the actions it would have performed instead of actually scaling resources.
Additionally, it sets the wait time between workload scans to 10 seconds.

:::

You can find a list of all possible arguments in [the cli argument docs](ref:docs-arguments).
