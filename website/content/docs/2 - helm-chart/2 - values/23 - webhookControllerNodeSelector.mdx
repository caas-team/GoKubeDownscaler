# webhookController.nodeSelector

The `webhookController.nodeSelector` value defines labels of nodes that you want the deployment to be scheduled on.

:::info

The default value for `webhookController.nodeSelector` is:

```yaml
webhookController:
  nodeSelector: {}
```

:::

If you want the GoKubeDownscaler Webhook Deployment to be scheduled on a specific type of node you can specify the
determining labels of the node here.

:::tip Example

If you set:

```yaml
webhookController:
  nodeSelector:
    disktype: ssd
    env: production
```

The GoKubeDownscaler Webhook Deployment will only be scheduled on a Node that has both the `disktype` label set to `ssd`
and the `env` label to `production`.
