# webhookController.image

The `webhookController.image` value contains the three fields `repository`, `pullPolicy` and `tag`:

- `repository` is the repository URL where the image versions of the GoKubeDownscaler are located
- `pullPolicy` specifies when the image should be pulled
- `tag` is the version tag of the image

:::info

The default values for `webhookController.image` are:

```yaml
webhookController:
  image:
    repository: ghcr.io/caas-team/gokubedownscaler-webhook
    pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    tag: ""
```

:::

Changing the value of `repository` will result in the images being pulled from another location.
It is advised to leave this as is unless you want or need to pull the images from a private registry of your choice.

There are three possible values for `pullPolicy`:

- `IfNotPresent` means that the image will only be pulled if it is not already present locally
- `Always` will always pull a container image unless the exact digest is already cached
- `Never` means that no image will be fetched and it has to be locally available

If `pullPolicy` field is left empty it will default to [Kubernetes' default value](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#imagepullpolicy-defaulting).
More info on the `imagePullPolicy` can be found on [the official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#image-pull-policy).

Changing the value of `tag` will deploy a different version of the GoKubeDownscaler.
If left empty like it is by default the GoKubeDownscaler will use the
[appVersion](repo:deployments/chart/Chart.yaml#L10) of the currently used Helm Chart.

You can find all versions of the GoKubeDownscaler [on the github releases page](https://github.com/caas-team/gokubedownscaler/releases).
