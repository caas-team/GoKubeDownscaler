# admissionController.certs

The `admissionController.certs` value contains the three fields `tlsCrt`, `tlsKey` and `caBundle`:

- `tlsCrt` is the TLS certificate used by the GoKubeDownscaler Webhook Deployment and stored in the dedicated Kubernetes Secret
- `tlsKey` is the TLS key used by the GoKubeDownscaler Webhook Deployment and stored in the dedicated Kubernetes Secret
- `caBundle` is the CA bundle used by the MutatingWebhookConfiguration to verify the TLS certificate of the GoKubeDownscaler Webhook Deployment.
  It is stored directly in the MutatingWebhookConfiguration

:::info

The default values for `admissionController.certs` subfields are empty, real values must be provided by the user:

```yaml
admissionController:
  certs:
    tlsCrt: ""
    tlsKey: ""
    caBundle: ""
```

:::

These values are important to ensure a secure communication between the GoKubeDownscaler Webhook Deployment and the Kubernetes API server.
