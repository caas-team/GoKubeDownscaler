# fullnameOverride

The `fullnameOverride` value overrides the names of the created Kubernetes objects with the provided name.

:::info

The default value for `fullnameOverride` is:

```yaml
fullnameOverride: ""
```

:::

If a value for `fullnameOverride` is set the Helm Chart will change the names of the following kubernetes objects to the one provided:

- Deployment
- ServiceAccount
- ClusterRole
- ClusterRoleBinding
- Role
- RoleBinding

Keep in mind however that the override is being cut off after 63 characters and will trim trailing hyphens.
