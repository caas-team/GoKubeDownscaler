# Workload Types

Valid values for the workload type are the case-insensitive kubernetes resource names of the workloads.
Workload types to be included in the scaling process can be specified using the
[`--include-resources`](ref:docs-runtime-configuration#include-resources) argument at the [CLI Scope](ref:docs-cli-scope#runtime-configuration)

## List of Workload Types

Here is a list of all the workload types supported by the Downscaler and how they are scaled.

### Cronjobs

- id: cronjobs
- resource: cronjob.v1.batch

Scales by setting the cronjobs suspend property to true, which halts further scheduled runs of the Cronjob.

### Daemonsets

- id: daemonsets
- resource: daemonset.v1.apps

Scales by setting the node selector to match none of the nodes, which stops pods from running on any node.

### Deployments

- id: deployments
- resource: deployment.v1.apps

Scales by setting the replica count to the [downscale replicas](ref:docs-values#downscale-replicas).

### HPAs

- id: horizontalpodautoscalers
- resource: horizontalpodautoscaler.v2.autoscaling

Scales by setting the minReplicas to the [downscale replicas](ref:docs-values#downscale-replicas).
If the [downscale replicas](ref:docs-values#downscale-replicas) are less than 1 it will throw an error.

### Jobs

- id: jobs
- resource: job.v1.batch

Scales by setting the suspend property to true, which stops the execution of the job until it is upscaled again.

### PodDisruptionBudgets

- id: poddisruptionbudgets
- resource: poddisruptionbudget.v1.policy

Scales by setting the maxUnavailable or minAvailable properties (depending on which one is used) to the
[downscale replicas](ref:docs-values#downscale-replicas).
[Percentage values](ref:docs-replicas#syntax) are supported as well

### ScaledObjects

- id: scaledobjects
- resource: scaledobject.v1alpha1.keda.sh

Scales by setting the paused replicas annotation to the [downscale replicas](ref:docs-values#downscale-replicas),
which scales the workloads managed by the scaled object to the [downscale replicas](ref:docs-values#downscale-replicas).

When scaled objects are [being scaled](ref:docs-runtime-configuration#include-resources) the downscaler will
automatically exclude the workloads the scaled objects are managing to avoid conflicts.

### Statefulsets

- id: statefulsets
- resource: statefulset.v1.apps

Scales by setting the replica count to the [downscale replicas](ref:docs-values#downscale-replicas).

### Rollouts

- id: Rollouts
- resource: rollout.v1alpha1.argoproj.io

Scales by setting the replica count to the [downscale replicas](ref:docs-values#downscale-replicas).

### Stacks

- id: stacks
- resource: stack.v1.zalando.org

Scales by setting the replica count to the [downscale replicas](ref:docs-values#downscale-replicas).

### Prometheuses

- id: prometheuses
- resource: prometheus.v1.monitoring.coreos.com

Scales by setting the replica count to the [downscale replicas](ref:docs-values#downscale-replicas).

### AutoscalingRunnerSets

- id: autoscalingrunnersets
- resource: autoscalingrunnerset.v1alpha1.actions.github.com

Scales by setting the minRunners count to the [downscale replicas](ref:docs-values#downscale-replicas).
