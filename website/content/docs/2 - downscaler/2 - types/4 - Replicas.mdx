# Replicas

Replicas can be a value of the desired number of replicas or the desired percentage value for scaling workloads.

## Syntax

Replicas can be represented as an integer for all workloads

```text
2 # 2 Replicas
```

Replicas can also be represented as a string percentage, for example, when targeting PodDisruption Budgets

```text
50% # 50% of the current replicas
```

:::warning

A percentage value can be used inside a Scope that is also targeting workloads that do not support percentage replicas
like PodDisruptionBudgets do.
This will result in an error on scaling workloads that do not support percentage-based
and will therefore skip any scaling of these resources unless a more specific scope overrides the downtime replicas value
