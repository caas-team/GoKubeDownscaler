# WeekFrame

WeekFrame is a value that can be set to specify the global weekframe in which the GoKubeDownscaler should operate when
evaluating timespans without a specific `<Weekday-From>-<Weekday-To>`.

## Syntax

WeekFrame is a value that consists of two case-insensitive weekdays separated by a hyphen (-)
to specify the week frame for the downscaler.

```text
Mon-Fri # set the global weekframe to be from Monday to Friday
```

### Valid Values

#### Weekdays

Case-insensitive:

- Mon
- Tue
- Wed
- Thu
- Fri
- Sat
- Sun
