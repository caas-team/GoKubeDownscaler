# Runtime Configuration

**Runtime Configurations** change how the Downscaler operates. controlling aspects like which namespaces and workload types
it should target, frequency of scans, retries, whether debugging information is enabled and more.
Runtime Configurations do not dictate how and when individual workloads are scaled.

## List Of Runtime Configurations

Here is a list of all the available runtime configurations for the Downscaler.

### Dry Run

- Type: boolean
- Description: Makes the downscaler print the changes it would have made instead of applying them.
  Will additionally enable [Debug](#debug).
- Default: false
- Where to set: [CLI Scope](ref:docs-cli-scope#runtime-configuration)

### Debug

- Type: boolean
- Description: Will print additional debug information.
- Default: false
- Where to set: [CLI Scope](ref:docs-cli-scope#runtime-configuration)

### Once

- Type: boolean
- Description: Makes the Downscaler only scan once before exiting.
- Default: false
- Where to set: [CLI Scope](ref:docs-cli-scope#runtime-configuration)

### Interval

- Type: [Duration](ref:docs-duration)
- Description: Sets the time the Downscaler waits between scans.
- Default: 30s
- Where to set: [CLI Scope](ref:docs-cli-scope#runtime-configuration)

### Namespace

- Type: [String List](ref:docs-string-list) (list of namespace names)
- Description: Sets the namespaces the Downscaler will scan over (restricts the 'cluster-wide' scopes to specific namespaces).
- Default: All Namespaces
- Where to set: [CLI Scope](ref:docs-cli-scope#runtime-configuration)

### Include Resources

- Type: [String List](ref:docs-string-list) (list of [workload types](ref:docs-workload-types))
- Description: Sets the resources/workload types the downscaler will scan over (restricts the 'cluster-wide' scopes to specific types).
- Default: `deployments`
- Where to set: [CLI Scope](ref:docs-cli-scope#runtime-configuration)
- works for components: KubeDownscaler (you can still specify this argument inside the Webhook but types configured inside the
  MutatingWebhookConfiguration takes precedence)

### Exclude Namespaces

- Type: [Regex List](ref:docs-regex-list) (list of regex patterns matching namespace names)
- Description: Makes the downscaler exclude workloads within matching namespaces (restricts the 'cluster-wide' scopes to exclude specific namespaces).
- Default: `kube-system`, `kube-downscaler`
- Where to set: [CLI Scope](ref:docs-cli-scope#runtime-configuration), [ENV Scope](ref:docs-env-scope)

### Exclude Deployments

- Type: [Regex List](ref:docs-regex-list) (list of regex patterns matching workload names)
- Description: Makes the downscaler exclude workloads with matching names (restricts the 'cluster-wide' scopes to exclude matching workloads).
- Default: none
- Where to set: [CLI Scope](ref:docs-cli-scope#runtime-configuration), [ENV Scope](ref:docs-env-scope)

### Matching Labels

- Type: [Regex List](ref:docs-regex-list) (list of regex patterns matching labels)
  :::info

  The Pattern has to match this pattern: `LABEL_NAME=LABEL_VALUE`.
  This means that to match the `example` label to be `"true"` you would put in `example=true`.
  To match a workload having the label no matter the value you would use `example=.*`.

  :::

- Description: Makes the downscaler only scale workloads whose labels match at least one of the patterns
  (restricts the 'cluster-wide' scopes to matching workloads).
- Default: none (the workloads don't have to match any label)
- Where to set: [CLI Scope](ref:docs-cli-scope#runtime-configuration)

### Time Annotation

- Type: string (annotation on workload containing an [RFC3339 formatted timestamp](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339))
- Description: Makes the downscaler check the [grace period](ref:docs-values#grace-period) against the value of the annotation
  instead of the creation time of the workload.
- Default: none (the downscaler will use the creation time of the workload)
- Where to set: [CLI Scope](ref:docs-cli-scope#runtime-configuration)

### Leader Election

- Type: boolean
- Description: Enforces leader election by creating [lease objects](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/leases/)
  to ensure only one instance of the GoKubeDownscaler is active at any given time to avoid conflicts.
- Default: false
- Where to set: [CLI Scope](ref:docs-cli-scope#runtime-configuration)
- Only works for component: KubeDownscaler

### Max Retries on Conflict

- Type: integer
- Description: Sets the maximum number of retries for handling HTTP 409 conflict errors,
  which occur when another entity modifies a resource that the downscaler is currently processing.
- Default: 0
- Where to set: [CLI Scope](ref:docs-cli-scope#runtime-configuration)
- Only works for component: KubeDownscaler

:::tip

We recommend setting this to a value greater than 0 when [once](#once) is enabled.
Since, in that case, the downscaler will only run once, you might want to perform retries if such conflicts occurs.

### Internal Cert Rotation

- Type: boolean
- Description: Enables automatic rotation of the TLS certificates used by the webhook server.
- Default: false
- Where to set: [CLI Scope](ref:docs-cli-scope#runtime-configuration)
- Only works for component: Webhook

### Webhook Service Name

- Type: string
- Description: Sets the name of the Kubernetes Service that exposes the webhook server.
  It is needed to ensure the correct
  functioning of the webhook when [internal certificate rotation](#internal-cert-rotation) is enabled.
- Default: `gokube-downscaler-webhook`
- Where to set: [CLI Scope](ref:docs-cli-scope#runtime-configuration)
- Only works for component: Webhook

### Cluster Domain

- Type: string
- Description: Sets the cluster domain used to construct the webhook service URL.
  It is needed to ensure the correct
  functioning of the webhook when [internal certificate rotation](#internal-cert-rotation) is enabled.
- Default: `cluster.local`
- Where to set: [CLI Scope](ref:docs-cli-scope#runtime-configuration)
- Only works for component: Webhook

### TLS Secret Name

- Type: string
- Description: Sets the name of the Kubernetes Secret that contains the TLS certificates for the webhook server.
  It is needed
  to ensure the correct functioning of the webhook when [internal certificate rotation](#internal-cert-rotation) is enabled.
- Default: `gokube-downscaler-webhook`
- Where to set: [CLI Scope](ref:docs-cli-scope#runtime-configuration)
- Only works for component: Webhook

### Kubeconfig

- Type: string (path to a kubeconfig file)
- Description: Makes the downscaler use the local kubeconfig instead of using the in-cluster config.
  It will use the `current-context` specified in the kubeconfig.
  The token/account used by the kubeconfig needs to have the [permissions necessary for scaling](ref:docs-helm-permissions).
- Default: none (the downscaler will use the in-cluster config)
- Where to set: [CLI Scope](ref:docs-cli-scope#runtime-configuration)
