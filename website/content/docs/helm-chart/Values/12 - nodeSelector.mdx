# nodeSelector

`nodeSelector` defines labels of nodes that you want the deployment to be scheduled on.

:::info
The default value for `nodeSelector` is:

```yaml
nodeSelector: {}
```

:::

If you want the GoKubeDownscaler to be scheduled on a specific type of node you can specify the determining labels of the node here.

:::tip For example:

If you set:

```yaml
nodeSelector:
  disktype: ssd
  env: production
```

the GoKubeDownscaler will only be scheduled on a Node that also has the labels `disktype: ssd` and `env: production`.
