# constrainedDownscaler

`constrainedDownscaler` sets the GoKubeDownscaler to a constrained state if true, meaning that it does not run clusterwide but restricted to a list of namespaces.

:::info
The default value for `constrainedDownscaler` is:

```yaml
constrainedDownscaler: false
```

:::

The namespaces the GoKubeDownscaler is constrained to are listed in [constrainedNamespaces][constrainedNamespaces].

:::warning
[constrainedNamespaces][constrainedNamespaces] cannot be empty if `constrainedDownscaler` is set to true!
:::

It will also create roles in each of these namespaces instead of a clusterrole for the needed [permissions][docs-helm-permissions].

This feature is very useful if you don't have the necessary rights to make a clusterwide installation.
