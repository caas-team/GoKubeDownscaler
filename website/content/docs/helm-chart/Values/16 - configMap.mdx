# configMap

`configMap` contains the two fields `name` and `extraConfig`:

- `name` defines the name of the configmap for the GoKubeDownscaler.
- `extraConfig` adds additional specified environment variables to the ConfigMap.

:::info
The default values for `configMap` are:

```yaml
configMap:
  name: go-kube-downscaler
  extraConfig: ""
```

:::

By default the `extraConfig` field is empty. Adding a line will change how the GoKubeDownscaler behaves.

:::tip For example:

```yaml
configMap:
  name: go-kube-downscaler
  extraConfig: |
    EXCLUDE_DEPLOYMENTS: deployment1, deployment2
```

This will add the `EXCLUDE_DEPLOYMENTS` environment variable to the configMap.

The given configuration will exclude the deployments with the name deployment1 and deployment2 from the scaling process of the GoKubeDownscaler even if they have a fitting annotation and are in a not excluded namespace.

:::

You can find a list of all possible environment variables [here][docs-environment-variables].
