# image

`image` contains the two fields `repository` and `tag`:

- `repository` is the repository URL where the image versions of the GoKubeDownscaler are located.
- `tag` is the version tag of the image.

:::info
The default values for `image` are:

```yaml
image:
  repository: ghcr.io/caas-team/gokubedownscaler
  tag: ""
```

:::

Changing the value of `repository` will result in the images being pulled from another location. It is advised to leave this as is unless you want or need to pull the images from a private registry of your choice.

Changing the value of `tag` will deploy a different version of the GoKubeDownscaler. If left empty like it is by default the GoKubeDownscaler will use the [appVersion][chart-appversion] of the currently used Helm Chart.

More details to versions of the GoKubeDownscaler can be found [here][github-releases].
