# resources

`resources` defines the CPU and memory limits and requests.

:::info
The default values for `resources` are:

```yaml
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 500m
    memory: 900Mi
  requests:
    cpu: 200m
    memory: 300Mi
```

:::

Here you can adjust the minimum and maximum amounts of cpu and memory the GoKubeDownscaler Pod is allowed to use.

The requests being the minimum and the limits being the maximum.

You can read more about this [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/).
