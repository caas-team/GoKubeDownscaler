# Components

The GoKubeDownscaler Helm Chart can create the following Kubernetes Objects:

## Deployment

The [deployment.yaml][deployment-yaml] file creates the main Deployment of the GoKubeDownscaler with a reference to the provided ServiceAccount and ConfigMap.

## Serviceaccount

The [serviceaccount.yaml][serviceaccount-yaml] file creates a ServiceAccount that will be used by the go-kube-downscaler to interact with Kubernetes.

## Configmap

The [configmap.yaml][configmap-yaml] file creates a new ConfigMap with the provided name. It is used to store environment variables like `EXCLUDE_NAMESPACES`.

## Clusterrole

The [clusterrole.yaml][clusterrole-yaml] file creates a ClusterRole and a ClusterRoleBinding for the desired cluster if [constrainedDownscaler][constrainedDownscaler] is set to false. These allow the actions the GoKubeDownscaler needs to scale down workloads in a clusterwide context.

## Role

The [role.yaml][role-yaml] file creates a Role and a RoleBinding for every namespace listed in [constrainedNamespaces][constrainedNamespaces] if [constrainedDownscaler][constrainedDownscaler] is set to true.
