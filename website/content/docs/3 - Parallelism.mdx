The Downscaler is natively designed to leverage parallel processing for scaling workloads. This capability becomes
particularly valuable in large clusters with numerous workloads that need to be scaled down at the same time.

## Optimizing CPU Limit

To enable parallelism the Downscaler should be allowed to expand its CPU usage dynamically.
This can be achieved by setting the CPU limit to a multiple of available cores. For example `2000m` enables using up to
2 VCPUs, `3000m` up to 3 VCPUs, `4000m` up to 4 VCPUs and so forth.

The number of workloads that can be processed in parallel increases as the number of vCPUs that can be used increases

For example, the following configuration allows the Downscaler to use up to 2 full vCPUs when the resources on the node
are available

```yaml
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 2000m
    memory: 900Mi
  requests:
    cpu: 200m
    memory: 300Mi
```
