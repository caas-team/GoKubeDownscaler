# Components

The following Kubernetes Objects can be created with our Helm Chart:

## Deployment

The [deployment.yaml](repo:deployments/chart/templates/deployment.yaml) file creates the main Deployment of the GoKubeDownscaler
with a reference to the provided ServiceAccount and ConfigMap.

## Serviceaccount

The [serviceaccount.yaml](repo:deployments/chart/templates/serviceaccount.yaml) file creates a ServiceAccount
that will be used by the GoKubeDownscaler to interact with Kubernetes.

## Configmap

The [configmap.yaml](repo:deployments/chart/templates/configmap.yaml) file creates a new ConfigMap with the provided name.
It is used to store environment variables like `EXCLUDE_NAMESPACES`.

## Clusterrole

The [clusterrole.yaml](repo:deployments/chart/templates/clusterrole.yaml) file creates a ClusterRole and a ClusterRoleBinding
for the desired cluster if there are no namespaces defined in [`constrainedNamespaces`](ref:docs-helm-constrained-namespaces).
These allow the actions the GoKubeDownscaler needs to scale down workloads in a clusterwide context.

## Role

The [role.yaml](repo:deployments/chart/templates/role.yaml) file creates a Role and a RoleBinding
for every namespace listed in [`constrainedNamespaces`](ref:docs-helm-constrained-namespaces).

## Leaserole

The [leaserole.yaml](repo:deployments/chart/templates/leaserole.yaml) file creates a Role and RoleBinding
if [`--leader-election`](ref:docs-runtime-configuration#leader-election) is enabled in order to make lease management possible.
