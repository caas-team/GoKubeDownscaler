# nodeSelector

The `nodeSelector` value defines labels of nodes that you want the deployment to be scheduled on.

:::info

The default value for `nodeSelector` is:

```yaml
nodeSelector: {}
```

:::

If you want the GoKubeDownscaler to be scheduled on a specific type of node you can specify the determining labels of the node here.

:::tip Example

If you set:

```yaml
nodeSelector:
  disktype: ssd
  env: production
```

The GoKubeDownscaler will only be scheduled on a Node that has both the `disktype` label set to `ssd` and the `env` label to `production`.
