# nameOverride

The `nameOverride` value overrides the chart name for the created Kubernetes objects.

:::info

The default value for `nameOverride` is:

```yaml
nameOverride: ""
```

:::

If a value for `nameOverride` is set the Helm Chart will adjust the names of the following kubernetes objects:

- Deployment
- ServiceAccount
- ClusterRole
- ClusterRoleBinding
- Role
- RoleBinding

:::tip Example

If you install the Helm Chart with a release name `my-release` and set:

```yaml
nameOverride: my-custom-name
```

The names of the mentioned kubernetes objects will be changed to `my-release-my-custom-name`.

:::

:::note

The override will be cut off after 63 characters and trailing hyphens will be trimmed.
