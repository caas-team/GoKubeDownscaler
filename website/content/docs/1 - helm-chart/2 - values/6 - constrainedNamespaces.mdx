# constrainedNamespaces

The `constrainedNamespaces` value is a comma separated list of namespaces the GoKubeDownscaler is going to operate on when constrained.
This means that it does not run clusterwide but restricted to the given namespaces.

:::info

The default value for `constrainedNamespaces` is:

```yaml
constrainedNamespaces: []
```

:::

If you want to constrain the GoKubeDownscaler to a set of namespaces you can configure it like this:

```yaml
constrainedNamespaces: [namespace1, namespace2, namespace3]
```

This ensures that theGoKubeDownscaler only has access to actions on the namespaces namespace1, namespace2 and namespace3.

It will also create roles in each of these namespaces instead of a clusterrole for the needed [permissions](ref:docs-helm-permissions).

This feature is very useful if you don't have the necessary rights to make a clusterwide installation.
