# serviceAccount

The `serviceAccount` value contains the two fields `create` and `name`:

- `create` is a boolean value indicating if a new ServiceAccount is supposed to be created
- `annotations` is a map of annotations you want to add to the serviceAccount
- `name` is the name of the ServiceAccount the GoKubeDownscaler is supposed to use

:::info

The default values for `serviceAccount` are:

```yaml
serviceAccount:
  create: true
  annotations: {}
  name: ""
```

:::

By default the Helm Chart will always create a service account for the GoKubeDownscaler with the name `[release-name]-go-kube-downscaler`.
The name of the created service account can be overridden by the `serviceAccount.name` field.
If you don't want to create a new service account you can set the serviceAccount.create field to false.
The Helm Chart will then try to use the `default` service account if no name was specified.
