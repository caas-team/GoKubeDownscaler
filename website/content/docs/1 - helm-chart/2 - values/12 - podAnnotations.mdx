# podAnnotations

The `podAnnotations` value is a map of annotations that the pods of the GoKubeDownscaler deployment will have.

:::info

The default value for `podAnnotations` is empty:

```yaml
podAnnotations: {}
```

:::

:::tip Example:

```yaml
podAnnotations: { "annotation1": "value1", "annotation2": "value2" }
```

This will set two annotations on each pod in the following format:

```yaml
annotations:
  annotation1: value1
  annotation2: value2
```
