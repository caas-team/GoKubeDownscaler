# replicaCount

The `replicaCount` value adjusts the number of replicas that the GoKubeDownscaler deployment will have.

:::info

The default value of `replicaCount` is:

```yaml
replicaCount: 1
```

:::

Changing this to a different integer value will result in the deployment of the provided number of pods.

:::warning

This value should not be changed because running multiple instances of the GoKubeDownscaler on the same workloads is currently not supported.
