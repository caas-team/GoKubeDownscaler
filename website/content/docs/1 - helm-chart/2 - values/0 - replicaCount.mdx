# replicaCount

The `replicaCount` value adjusts the number of replicas that the GoKubeDownscaler deployment will have.

:::info

The default value of `replicaCount` is:

```yaml
replicaCount: 1
```

:::

Changing this to a different integer value will result in the deployment of the provided number of pods.

If this value is greater than one the [`--leader-election`](ref:docs-runtime-configuration#leader-election)
argument will automatically be set on all created pods.
This will in turn create [lease objects](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/leases/)
to ensure only one instance of the GoKubeDownscaler is active at any given time to avoid conflicts.

You can find more information on how leases enable leader election on
[the official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/leases/#leader-election).
