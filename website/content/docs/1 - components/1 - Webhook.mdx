# Webhook

The **Webhook** is an optional component of GoKubeDownscaler.
It works by intercepting the creation or update requests of workloads and evaluating
them against the defined schedules and configurations.
If a workload matches the criteria to be scaled down upon creation or update, the Webhook
modifies the creation/update request to set the number of replicas to the target downscale value.

:::note

Different from the Downscaler, the Webhook only acts on the creation or update of workloads.
It does not periodically check and scale workloads
like the Downscaler does.

## How It Works

The Webhook operates as follows:

1. **Intercept Requests**: The Webhook intercepts the creation or update requests of workloads
2. **Evaluate Workload**: The Webhook evaluates the workload against the defined schedules and configurations to determine if it should be
   scaled down upon creation or update
3. **Modify Workload**: If the workload needs to be scaled down, the Webhook modifies the request to set the number of replicas to the
   target downscale value

The Webhook can only be installed cluster-wide, since it operates at the API server level.

The details of how the Downscaler evaluates workloads and determines scaling actions are covered in the
[Scopes And Scaling](ref:docs-scopes-and-scaling) section.

## When to Use the Webhook

There are a couple of scenarios where using the Webhook is beneficial:

- **Immediate Compliance**: It is useful when the organization wants to ensure that all newly created or updated workloads are immediately compliant
  with the scaling policies defined by the organization.
- **Avoid Short-term Provisioning**: When workloads are created or updated during a downtime period, the Webhook can ensure they are downscaled
  immediately, avoiding short-term node provisioning and deprovisioning (and the associated useless costs)
