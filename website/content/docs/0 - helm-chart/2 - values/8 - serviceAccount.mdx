# serviceAccount

The `serviceAccount` value contains the two fields `create` and `name`:

- `create` is a boolean value indicating if a new ServiceAccount is supposed to be created.
- `name` is the name of the ServiceAccount the GoKubeDownscaler is supposed to use.

:::info
The default values for `serviceAccount` are:

```yaml
serviceAccount:
  create: true
  name: ""
```

:::

By default the Helm Chart will always create a service account for the GoKubeDownscaler with the name\
`[release-name]-go-kube-downscaler`.

This name can be overridden by the serviceAccount.name field.

If you don't want to create a new service account you can set the serviceAccount.create field to false.

The Helm Chart will then by default try to assign the service account with the `default` name to the GoKubeDownscaler.

This can again be changed by providing a name in the serviceAccount.name field.
