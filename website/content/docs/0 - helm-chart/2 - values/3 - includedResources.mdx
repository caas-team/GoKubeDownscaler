# includedResources

The `includedResources` value defines all the resource types that the GoKubeDownscaler is supposed to be able to handle.

:::info
The default value for `includedResources` is:

```yaml
includedResources:
  - deployments
```

:::

For every resource in this list the Helm Chart will create a set of [permissions][docs-helm-permissions] and assign them to the role for the GoKubeDownscaler.

Supported resources are:

- Deployments
- Statefulsets
- Daemonsets
- Rollouts
- HorizontalPodAutoscalers
- Jobs
- Cronjobs
- ScaledObjects
- Stacks
- PodDisruptionBudgets
- Prometheuses

:::tip

An example for including resources can look like this:

```yaml
includedResources:
  - deployments
  - statefulsets
  - daemonsets
  - rollouts
  - horizontalpodautoscalers
  - jobs
  - cronjobs
  - scaledobjects
  - stacks
  - poddisruptionbudgets
  - prometheuses
```
