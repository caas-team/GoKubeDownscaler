# tolerations

`tolerations` adds tolerations to the pod of the deployment to be able to be scheduled on nodes with matching taints.

:::info
The default value for `tolerations` is:

```yaml
tolerations: []
```

:::

This field allows the GoKubeDownscaler pod to be scheduled on Nodes with certain taints.

If you want to allow the GoKubeDownscaler pod to schedule on a Node with a taint `key1=value1:NoSchedule` you can set:

```yaml
tolerations:
  - key: "key1"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "value1"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
```

You can find more info about taints and tolerations [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/).
