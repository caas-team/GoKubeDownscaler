# nameOverride

`nameOverride` overrides the chart name for the created Kubernetes objects.

:::info
The default value for `nameOverride` is:

```yaml
nameOverride: ""
```

:::

If a value for `nameOverride` is set the Helm Chart will adjust the names of the following kubernetes objects:

- Deployment
- ClusterRole
- ClusterRoleBinding
- Role
- RoleBinding

So if you for example install the Helm Chart with the release name `my-release` and set:

```yaml
nameOverride: my-custom-name
```

the names of the mentioned kubernetes objects will be changed to `my-release-my-custom-name`.

Keep in mind however that the override is being cut off after 63 characters and will trim trailing hyphens.
