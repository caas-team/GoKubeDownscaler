# Developing

Guides on how to start developing on the GoKubeDownscaler.

Before you contribute to the project we would advise you to read the [Contribution Manifest](repo:CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Forking the Repository

To contribute you have to fork [the repository](https://github.com/caas-team/GoKubeDownscaler) first.

To do this you have to click [`Fork`](https://github.com/caas-team/GoKubeDownscaler/fork) in the top right of [the repository](https://github.com/caas-team/GoKubeDownscaler).
After that you can just follow the instructions on the page and click `Create fork`.

## Cloning the Repository

To work on the downscaler effectively you should clone the repository onto your system.
You can find instructions on how to install git [on their website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/GoKubeDownscaler.git
cd GoKubeDownscaler
```

## Setting up Pre-Commit

[Pre-Commit](https://pre-commit.com) is a framework for running checks before committing,
this ensures that formatting stays consistent,
stops you from committing to protected branches (locally)
and stops you from committing broken code or new functionality without updating the tests.

### Recommended Installation

The recommended way to install pre-commit and the needed dependencies is via `brew`.
If you don't have brew installed on your system you can find how to install it by following the instructions on [their website](https://brew.sh).

```bash
brew install pre-commit
```

The Pre-Commit checks for the Downscaler have some dependencies which need to be installed manually.

```bash
brew install golangci-lint
brew install gofumpt
```

### Alternative Installation

Alternatively you can install pre-commit and the dependencies manually.
Installation instructions for pre-commit can be found [on their website](https://pre-commit.com/#install).
Additionally you will need to install [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/welcome/install/#local-installation)
and [gofumpt](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt) as dependencies for the pre-commit checks of the downscaler.

### Enabling Pre-Commit

Next we will have to enabling pre-commit for the repository.
Make sure you are in the GoKubeDownscaler git repository.

```bash
pre-commit install
```

### Running Pre-Commit Manually

Sometimes it can be useful to run pre-commit without also committing
or just letting it run on all files instead of just the changed ones.

This command lets you start a pre-commit run on all files manually:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

#### Skipping Pre-Commit Checks Temporarily

Pre-Commit normally shouldn't be ignored, but in some cases you might need to skip some or all pre-commit checks temporarily.
All checks will run in the pre-commit workflow once you push your changes and haven't resolved the issues.

To disable one or multiple checks:

```bash
SKIP=prevent-todo-comments,another-check-id-here pre-commit run --all-files
```

or

```bash
SKIP=prevent-todo-comments,another-check-id-here git commit
```

If you need to disable all checks you can run this to skip all git hooks:

```bash
git commit --no-verify
```
