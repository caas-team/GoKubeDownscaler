# Helm Chart

This section covers how to start developing on the Helm chart of the downscaler.

If you haven't already, read and follow the instructions for [setting up the repository locally](ref:contributing-developing).

## Installing Helm

Before making changes to the Helm chart you should install Helm since it is required in order to install the chart and test any changes.

You can either use brew to install Helm:

```bash
brew install helm
```

Or you can install it [another way](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

To check if the installation was successful you can run:

```bash
helm version
```

The output should be something like:

```text
version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.16.1", GitCommit:"5a5449dc42be07001fd5771d56429132984ab3ab", GitTreeState:"clean", GoVersion:"go1.22.7"}
```

## Adding a Template

Manifest files, which are YAML-formatted resource descriptions that Kubernetes can understand are generated
using Go templates when installing the Helm chart.

All templates that generate manifest files when installing the Helm chart are located at `./deployments/chart/templates`.

To add a template you can just create a yaml file in this folder.

The basic structure of these files will generally be just the
[Kubernetes manifest structure](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/#describing-a-kubernetes-object)
(`apiVersion, kind, metadata, spec`) of the object you want to deploy.

:::tip Example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap
data:
  examplevalue: "Hello World"
```

:::

## Making a Template Configurable

Normally you don't want to hard code everything inside a Helm template.

Since you would want to create a unique name or add a unique attribute to your installation
it is a good idea to replace all values you want to be modifiable with a template call.

:::info

The Helm template language is implemented in the [strongly typed Go programming language](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template?utm_source=godoc).

This means that template directives are enclosed in `{{` and `}}` blocks.

:::

### Built-in Objects

In order to create a dynamic name for a configmap you can use a built-in object of the template engine:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {{ .Release.Name }}-configmap
data:
  examplevalue: "Hello World"
```

Your configmap's name will now be dynamically generated depending on the name of your Helm installation.

:::tip Example

```bash
helm install my-chart ./deployments/chart
```

Resulting manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  # highlight-start
  name: my-chart-configmap
  # highlight-end
data:
  examplevalue: "Hello World"
```

:::

You can find a list of all the built-in objects you can use on [the official Helm docs page](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/builtin_objects/).

### Values.yaml

Another easy way to add configurability to a template is adding values into the values.yaml located at `./deployments/chart/values.yaml`.

A value to add for data in the configmap could be:

```yaml title="values.yaml"
bestWeekDay: saturday
```

To reference this value you have to add:

```yaml title="configmap.yaml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {{ .Release.Name }}-configmap
data:
  examplevalue: "Hello World"
  # highlight-start
  day: {{ .Values.bestWeekDay }}
  # highlight-end
```

This will then generate the following manifest when running `helm install weekday ./deployments/chart`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: weekday-configmap
data:
  examplevalue: "Hello World"
  day: saturday
```

This makes it easy for users to adjust these values to their needs
since they only need to change a field in the values.yaml to customize their installation.

You can find a more detailed rundown on values on [the official Helm docs](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/values_files/).

## Helpers

Inside the \_helpers.tpl located at `./deployments/chart/templates/_helpers.tpl`
you can find named templates which are custom yaml definitions that can be called across the different manifests.

A helper definition could look like this:

```go title="_helpers.tpl"
{{/*
This is a describing comment.
*/}}
{{- define "test.labels" -}}
  labels:
    test: label
{{- end }}
```

In the code above is a describing comment encapsulated in `{{/*` and `*/}}` for the yaml definition below.

The definition starts with the `define` keyword followed by the name you want to give your template in quotes.

Inside the definition is everything you want to add when calling this template
and this is then closed by the `end` keyword to mark the end of your named template.

To reference this template you have to add:

```yaml title="configmap.yaml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {{ .Release.Name }}-configmap
  # highlight-start
  {{ include "test.labels" . }}
  # highlight-end
data:
  examplevalue: "Hello World"
  day: {{ .Values.bestWeekDay }}
```

This will then generate the following manifest when running `helm install helper ./deployments/chart`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: helper-configmap
  labels:
    test: label
data:
  examplevalue: "Hello World"
  day: saturday
```

## Bumping Version Numbers

After you have made changes to the Helm chart and want to release a new version you should bump the version number of the chart.

This can be done inside the Chart.yaml file located at `./deployments/chart/Chart.yaml`.

In there you will want to bump the `version` field because this refers to the version of the Helm chart.

This will then automatically [create a new release](ref:contributing-maintaining-repo#releasing-a-new-version) for the Helm chart via our [workflows](ref:contributing-github-workflows).

However it might be a good idea to couple the release of the Helm chart to a release of the GoKubeDownscaler.
In that case you also want to bump the `appVersion` field.

```yaml title="Chart.yaml"
apiVersion: v2
name: go-kube-downscaler
description: A Helm chart for deploying the go-kube-downscaler
type: application
keywords:
  - kube-downscaler
  - go
  - downscaling
# highlight-start
version: 1.2.0
appVersion: 1.2.0
# highlight-end
icon: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caas-team/GoKubeDownscaler/refs/heads/main/logo/kubedownscaler.svg

```

Our versioning is structured according to [SemVer](https://semver.org/), ensuring predictable and structured updates.

## Troubleshooting

Debugging templates can be tricky because the rendered templates are sent to the Kubernetes API server,
which may reject the YAML files for reasons other than formatting.

There are a few commands that can help you debug:

- `helm lint` is your go-to tool for verifying that your chart follows best practices
- `helm template --debug` will test render chart templates locally.
- `helm install --dry-run --debug` will also render your chart locally without installing it,
  but will also check if conflicting resources are already running on the cluster.
  Setting --dry-run=server will additionally execute any lookup in your chart towards the server.
- `helm get manifest` is a good way to see what templates are installed on the server.

When your YAML is failing to parse, but you want to see what is generated,
one easy way to retrieve the YAML is to comment out the problem section in the template,
and then re-run `helm install --dry-run --debug`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v2
# some: problem section
# {{ .Values.foo | quote }}
```

This provides a quick way of viewing the generated content without YAML parse errors blocking.
