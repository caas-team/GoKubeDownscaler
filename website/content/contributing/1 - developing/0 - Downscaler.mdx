# Downscaler

This section covers how to start development on the downscaler.

If you haven't already, read and follow the instructions for [setting up the repository locally](ref:guides-developing).

The files for the downscaler can mainly be found in `./cmd/kubedownscaler` and `./internal`.

## Installing Prerequisite

Before you start modifying the downscaler you should install its prerequisites.

### Installing Go

Installing go is necessary to be able to run the downscaler locally.

You can either use brew to install and update go:

```bash
brew install go
```

To update go using brew:

```bash
brew upgrade go
```

Or you can follow [these instructions](https://go.dev/doc/install) to install go another way.

After that you can check if your installation was successful.

```bash
go version
```

The output should be something like:

```text
go version go1.23.2 linux/amd64
```

### Installing Dependencies

Once you have go installed you can start installing the Kubedownscalers dependencies.

```bash
go mod download
```

## Running the Downscaler Locally

To run the downscaler locally you need to specify a kubeconfig for it to use.
The downscaler will use the current-context selected in the kubeconfig.
The user of the selected context has to have the [permissions required to scale](ref:docs-helm-permissions).

```bash
go run ./cmd/kubedownscaler -k path/to/kubeconfig
```

## Testing the Downscaler

To test your code changes you should write or change existing tests to match your new functionality.

You can run all tests like this:

```bash
go test ./...
```

## Compiling/Building

You normally don't need to build the binary or docker image locally
as workflows handle building those for releasing new versions.
This is only necessary for e.g. testing the docker image.

### Binary

This is how you can build a binary of the kubedownscaler:

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o bin/gokubedownscaler ./cmd/kubedownscaler
```

Disabling CGO isn't strictly required although leaving it enabled does sometimes lead to problems.

### Docker Image

Building the Docker image is just like building any other Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t ghcr.io/caas-team/gokubedownscaler:someTag .
```

## Running the Docker Image Locally

To run the Docker container locally you also need to specify a kubeconfig.

```bash
docker run -v path/to/kubeconfig:/app/kubeconfig ghcr.io/caas-team/gokubedownscaler:latest -k=/app/kubeconfig
```
