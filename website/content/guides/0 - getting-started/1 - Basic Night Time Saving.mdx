# Basic Night Time Saving

One of the easiest ways and most common use cases for the Downscaler is using it for night time saving.

A good time to start saving resources at night could be from 6:00 PM to 8:00 AM during weekdays and on weekends.

Depending on your use case you can apply the night time saving clusterwide or on either namespace or workload level.

## Clusterwide

In order to apply the wanted downtime clusterwide the GoKubeDownscaler has to know what downtime to use.

This can be done by either using an [environment variable](ref:docs-environment-variables) or a [cli argument](ref:docs-arguments) for the GoKubeDownscaler.

### Environment Variable

If you want to add a clusterwide downtime with environment variables
you can add them inside the [values.yaml](repo:deployments/chart/values.yaml) file.

There you have to add it to the `configMap.extraConfig` field:

```yaml title="values.yaml"
# ...

configMap:
  name: go-kube-downscaler
  extraConfig: |
    DEFAULT_DOWNTIME: "Mon-Fri 18:00-08:00 UTC, Sat-Sun 00:00-24:00 UTC"

# ...
```

### Cli Argument

If you want to instead use a cli argument for the clusterwide downtime
you can also add them inside the [values.yaml](repo:deployments/chart/values.yaml) file.

There you have to add it to the `arguments` field:

```yaml title="values.yaml"
# ...

arguments:
  - --default-downtime="Mon-Fri 18:00-08:00 UTC, Sat-Sun 00:00-24:00 UTC"
# ...
```

After setting the variable in one of the two ways
all workloads in your cluster will be scaled down on every weekday from 6:00 PM to 8:00 AM and on weekends.

## Namespace Level

To set this up for all workloads in a namespace you have to annotate the namespace with the wanted time span.

This can be done using a `kubectl` command or by editing the namespace's yaml manifest.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="kubectl" label="kubectl" default>
    Adding the downtime with kubectl is a single command:

    ```bash
    kubectl annotate ns my-namespace downscaler/downtime="Mon-Fri 18:00-08:00 UTC, Sat-Sun 00:00-24:00 UTC"
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manifest" label="Edit manifest">
    If you want to edit the annotations manually with a yaml manifest file
    or by running `kubectl edit ns my-namespace` you have to add the following:

    ```yaml title="my-namespace.yaml"
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
      name: my-namespace
      # highlight-start
      annotations:
        downscaler/downtime: "Mon-Fri 18:00-08:00 UTC, Sat-Sun 00:00-24:00 UTC"
      # highlight-end
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now all workloads in `my-namespace` will be scaled down on every weekday from 6:00 PM to 8:00 AM
and on weekends.

## Workload Level

To set this up for individual workloads you have to set an annotation on each workload you want to scale down.

This can also be done by either using a `kubectl` command or by editing the workload's yaml manifest.

For demo purposes we will showcase this with a deployment.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="kubectl" label="kubectl" default>
    Adding the downtime with kubectl is a single command:

    ```bash
    kubectl annotate deployment my-deployment downscaler/downtime="Mon-Fri 18:00-08:00 UTC, Sat-Sun 00:00-24:00 UTC"
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manifest" label="Edit manifest">
    If you want to edit the annotations manually with a yaml manifest file
    or by running `kubectl edit deployment my-deployment` you have to add the following:

    ```yaml title="my-deployment.yaml"
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: my-deployment
      # highlight-start
      annotations:
        downscaler/downtime: "Mon-Fri 18:00-08:00 UTC, Sat-Sun 00:00-24:00 UTC"
      # highlight-end
    spec:
      replicas: 3
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: nginx
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: nginx
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: nginx
            image: nginx:1.14.2
            ports:
            - containerPort: 80
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now your deployment my-deployment will be scaled down on every weekday from 6:00 PM to 8:00 AM and on weekends.
