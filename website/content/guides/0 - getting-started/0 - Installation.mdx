# Installation

We provide a Helm Chart for an easy installation of the GoKubeDownscaler.

## Prerequisites

In order to get started installing the GoKubeDownscaler using our Helm Chart you need:

- [Helm installed](https://helm.sh/docs/intro) on a system
- access to a Kubernetes cluster

Also make sure your context is set to the right cluster and namespace where you want to deploy the GoKubeDownscaler.

## Constrained Installation vs Cluster-Wide Installation

As described in the [introduction page](ref:docs-introduction#installation-and-architecture), the GoKubeDownscaler can be installed in two
different ways:

- **Constrained Installation**: The GoKubeDownscaler is only allowed to operate on a set of namespaces.
  This is useful if you don't have the necessary rights to make a cluster-wide installation.
- **Cluster-Wide Installation**: The GoKubeDownscaler is allowed to operate on all namespaces in the cluster.
  This is useful if you want to scale down workloads across the entire cluster.

In order to install the GoKubeDownscaler in a constrained way you must set the `constrainedNamespaces` value.
This can be done in two ways:

- by passing the `--set constrainedNamespaces=[namespace1,namespace2,...]` argument to the `helm install` or `helm template` command shown
  in the next section
- by setting it in the `values.yaml` file.

[This documentation page](ref:docs-helm-constrained-namespaces) explains how to use this argument and what it does under the hood

## Install the Chart with Helm

In order to install the chart on your cluster you only need to run one simple command:

```bash
helm upgrade -i gokubedownscaler oci://ghcr.io/caas-team/charts/go-kube-downscaler
```

This will install the latest version of our helm chart into your Kubernetes cluster.

You can also alternatively add our helm chart repo in order to install the chart.

```bash
helm repo add caas-team https://caas-team.github.io/helm-charts/
```

This will add all of our published Helm Charts to a local Helm repo named caas-team.

After that you just need to run the following command:

```bash
helm install go-kube-downscaler caas-team/go-kube-downscaler
```

## Install With Kubernetes Manifests

Alternatively you can install the Downscaler using the Kubernetes manifests generated by the Helm Template command.
This is useful if you want to install the Downscaler without using Helm or if you want to include the Donwscaler in your custom chart.

First you need to add our Helm repo:

```bash
helm repo add caas-team https://caas-team.github.io/helm-charts/
```

You need to extract the Kubernetes manifests from the Helm Chart and save them to a file:

```bash
helm template go-kube-downscaler caas-team/go-kube-downscaler > go-kube-downscaler.yaml
```

Then you can apply the generated manifest to your cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f go-kube-downscaler.yaml
```

## Customize the Installation

In order to customize your installation of the GoKubeDownscaler
you can adjust the [values.yaml](repo:deployments/chart/values.yaml) provided with the chart.

Check our [value docs page](ref:docs-helm-values) for a detailed overview of all options.
