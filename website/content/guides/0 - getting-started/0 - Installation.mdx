# Installation

We provide a Helm Chart for an easy installation of the GoKubeDownscaler.

## Prerequisites

In order to get started installing the GoKubeDownscaler using our Helm Chart you need:

- [Helm installed](https://helm.sh/docs/intro) on a system
- access to a Kubernetes cluster

Also make sure your context is set to the right cluster and namespace where you want to deploy the GoKubeDownscaler.

## Install the Chart

In order to install the chart on your cluster you only need to run one simple command:

```bash
helm upgrade -i gokubedownscaler oci://ghcr.io/caas-team/charts/go-kube-downscaler
```

This will install the latest version of our helm chart into your Kubernetes cluster.

You can also alternatively add our helm chart repo in order to install the chart.

```bash
helm repo add caas-team https://caas-team.github.io/helm-charts/
```

This will add all of our published Helm Charts to a local Helm repo named caas-team.

After that you just need to run the following command:

```bash
helm install go-kube-downscaler caas-team/go-kube-downscaler
```

In order to customize your installation of the GoKubeDownscaler
you can adjust the [values.yaml](repo:deployments/chart/values.yaml) provided with the chart.

Check our [value docs page](ref:docs-helm-values) for a detailed overview of all options.
