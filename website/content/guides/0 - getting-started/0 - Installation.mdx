# Installation

We provide a Helm Chart for an easy installation of the GoKubeDownscaler.

## Prerequisites

In order to get started installing the GoKubeDownscaler using our Helm Chart you need:

- [Helm installed](https://helm.sh/docs/intro) on a system
- access to a Kubernetes cluster

Also make sure your context is set to the right cluster and namespace where you want to deploy the GoKubeDownscaler.

## Install the Chart

In order to install the chart you only need to add our Helm Chart repository by running:

```bash
helm repo add caas-team https://caas-team.github.io/helm-charts/
```

Followed by the actual install command:

```bash
helm install go-kube-downscaler caas-team/go-kube-downscaler
```

Now the GoKubeDownscaler should be properly installed.

:::tip

You can find out how to customize your installation of the GoKubeDownscaler [in the helm chart documentation](ref:docs-helm-values).
