# Maintaining the Repository

This section covers how to do some maintainer tasks on the repository.

For documentation on the workflows see [this documentation page](ref:docs-workflows).

## Releasing a New Version

The process to releasing a new version is almost completely automated.
There are multiple workflows that handle the release process.
All you need to do is to bump the [semver](https://semver.org) of either
the Helm chart version(`.version`) or the app version(`.appVersion`)
within the [Chart.yaml](repo:deployments/chart/Chart.yaml)(`./deployments/chart/Chart.yaml`).
Once merged into main the [workflows](ref:docs-workflows) will automatically start releasing the new version.

:::info

To merge a pull request which would result in a new version once merged into main
there is an additional approval step to stop you from accidentally merging it without realizing.

To allow the pull request to make a new release after being merged you need to add the <GithubLabel label="new release"/> label to it.
This will in turn retrigger [the workflow](ref:docs-workflows#check-for-release) run
which then automatically removes the <GithubLabel label="needs approval"/> label and allows the pull request to be merged.
