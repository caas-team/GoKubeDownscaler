# Website

This section covers how to start developing on the website of the downscaler.

If you haven't already, read and follow the instructions for [setting up the repository locally](ref:guides-developing).

## Installing Prerequisite

Before being able to develop on the website you need to install some prerequisites.

### Installing Npm

NPM is required to be able to install the required packages to start the website.

You can either use brew to install npm:

```bash
brew install node
```

Or you can install it [another way](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#using-a-node-installer-to-install-nodejs-and-npm).

To check if the installation was successful you can run:

```bash
node -v
```

and

```bash
npm -v
```

The output should be something like:

```text
v22.6.0
```

for node and

```text
10.8.2
```

for npm.

### Installing Dependencies

After npm is installed you can install the websites dependencies.

```bash
npm install --prefix website
```

### Updating Dependencies

After pulling new commits that changed `package.json` you should update your node packages.

To update the dependencies you can use:

```bash
npm update --prefix website
```

## Running the Website Locally

Now that the prerequisites are installed you can start the website.

```bash
npm run --prefix website start
```

If you want to test features which are only available on the built site (e.g. search) use:

```bash
npm run --prefix website build && npm run --prefix website serve
```

This will disable hot reloads, so you will have to rerun the command every time you changed something to see it on the site.

## Starting Development

The following section covers the basics of how to make changes to the website.
You can find more information on configuring this site in the [official docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs).

All files for the website can be found in `./website`.

### Adding/Changing Pages and Categories

The website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) which allows for documentation/guides pages to be markdown or mdx files.
The markdown files are located in `./website/content/guides` and `./website/content/docs`.

#### Pages

You can edit a page just by editing its mdx file.
You can find information on markdown and MDX syntax [on the docusaurus website](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features).

To add a new page you can just add a `.mdx` file into any of the existing folders.
Docusaurus will automatically build the changes and add the file as an entry into the sidebar.

#### Categories

You can add categories by adding folders in the `guides` or `docs` folders.
Categories don't have an index by default, so you will need to create one.

You can do this by creating an index.mdx file within the folder of the category.
You could either just put a category description in them or fill them up with content themselves.
Either way you should present the user with the items in the category with a DocCardList:

```mdx title="index.mdx" showLineNumbers
---
title: Some Category Title
id: some-category
---

import DocCardList from "@theme/DocCardList";

# Some Category Title

Some category description

{/* Optional Main content for the category */}

## Overview

<DocCardList />
```

#### Sidebar Structure and Order

The structure of the guides and docs is basically the same as on the built website.
Folders are categories, mdx files are pages.
Category indexes are the `index.mdx` files located in the folders of their respective categories.

The order in the sidebar is defined by number prefixes:

- 0 - First Document (you could also start with 1)
- 1 - Second Document
- 2 - Third Document
- n - nᵗʰ Document

### Markdown Links

#### External sites

Links to external sites are just normal markdown syntax: `[some text](https://example.com)`

#### Heading

The same counts for links to a heading on the same page: `[some text](#heading-id)`

#### Github GoKubeDownscaler Repository

To link to a file in the repository you can use the `repo:` directive:

- `[some text](repo:path/to/file)`
- `[some text](repo:/path/to/file)`
- `[some text](repo:./path/to/file)`

-> `https://github.com/caas-team/GoKubeDownscaler/tree/main/path/to/file`

To just link to the Downscaler repository:

- `[some text](repo)`

-> `https://github.com/caas-team/GoKubeDownscaler`

#### Another Guide or Documentation

To link to another doc or guide, you first have to define a `globalReference` for that document.
To do that you just have to add the `globalReference` attribute to the frontmatter of the document:

```mdx
---
title: Example
id: example
# highlight-next-line
globalReference: docs-example
---
```

after which you can use the reference to link to the document from any other:

```mdx
Some [example](ref:docs-example) text.
```

:::info
If you added the link reference in the mdx file
before adding the `globalReference` parameter to the frontmatter
docusaurus might not rebuild your page until you either
re-save your file to initiate a rebuild or
[clear the docusaurus cache](#clear-docusaurus-cache).
:::

### Best Practices

These are a collection of best practices you should be aware of:

- [avoid click here links](https://heyoka.medium.com/dont-use-click-here-f32f445d1021)
- try to reduce the use of inline-html elements to a minimum
- avoid too small headings (keep it under h5 and try to avoid h4)
- don't nest sidebar categories (no categories in a category in a category)
- use [title case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalization#Title_case) for headings

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes the website looks broken/not how you expected, has errors or won't start/open.
In these cases you have probably tried loads of things to get it working again.
These are some of the most common fixes for such issues.

### Clear Docusaurus Cache

Docusaurus caches most files and doesn't rebuild them until they themselves change (e.g. rendered markdown files, [SVGO](https://svgo.dev/)/[SVGR](https://react-svgr.com/) optimized SVGs, etc.).
This can lead to problems when there are custom external dependencies which don't trigger a rebuild.

This command forces docusaurus to clear its cache and rebuild all files on the next start.

```bash
npm run --prefix website docusaurus clear
```

### (Re-)Install Packages

There are multiple reasons why reinstalling NPMs packages might fix some issues.
Some of the most common reasons could be:

- corrupted modules
- outdated packages ([`npm update`](#updating-dependencies) could also resolve this)
- ...

```bash
rm -rf ./website/node_modules
npm install --prefix website
```
