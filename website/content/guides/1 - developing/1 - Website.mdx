# Website

This section covers how to start developing on the website of the downscaler.

If you haven't already, read and follow the instructions for [setting up the repository locally][guides-developing].

## Installing Prerequisite

Before being able to develop on the website you need to install some prerequisites.

### Installing Npm

NPM is required to be able to install the required packages to start the website.

You can either use brew to install npm:

```bash
brew install node
```

Or you can install it [another way][npm-install].

To check if the installation was successful you can run:

```bash
node -v
```

and

```bash
npm -v
```

The output should be something like:

```text
v22.6.0
```

for node and

```text
10.8.2
```

for npm.

### Installing Dependencies

After npm is installed you can install the websites dependencies.

```bash
npm install --prefix website
```

### Updating Dependencies

After pulling new commits that changed `package.json` you should update your node packages.

To update the dependencies you can use:

```bash
npm update --prefix website
```

## Running the Website Locally

Now that the prerequisites are installed you can start the website.

```bash
npm run --prefix website start
```

## Starting Development

The following section covers the basics of how to make changes to the website.
You can find more information on configuring this site in the [official docusaurus documentation][docusaurus].

All files for the website can be found in `./website`.

### Adding/Changing Pages and Categories

The website is built using [Docusaurus][docusaurus] which allows for documentation/guides pages to be markdown or mdx files.
The markdown files are located in `./website/content/guides` and `./website/content/docs`.

#### Pages

You can edit a page just by editing its mdx file.
You can find information on markdown and MDX syntax [on the docusaurus website][docusaurus-markdown-docs].

To add a new page you can just add a `.mdx` file into any of the existing folders.
Docusaurus will automatically build the changes and add the file as an entry into the sidebar.

#### Categories

You can add categories by adding folders in the `guides` or `docs` folders.
Categories don't have an index by default, so you will need to create one.
Category indexes are the //TODO

#### Sidebar Structure and Order

The structure of the guides and docs is basically the same as on the built website.
Folders are categories, mdx files are pages.
Category indexes are the index.mdx files in their respective categories' folders.

ORder //TODO

### Markdown Links

//TODO

### Best Practices

//TODO

avoid click here links

avoid using inline-html in markdown (excluded Doccard)

try to avoid too small headings h3 is good h4 is to be avoided and h5 and smaller should not be used

Dont make too deep Categories. Try to stick to not putting Categories in Categories in Categories. (3 deep is too deep)

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes the website looks broken/not how you expected, has errors or won't start/open.
In these cases you have probably tried loads of things to get it working again.
These are some of the most common fixes for such issues.

### Clear Docusaurus Cache

Docusaurus caches most files and doesn't rebuild them until they themselves change (eg. rendered markdown files, [SVGO][svgo]/[SVGR][svgr] optimized SVGs, etc.).
This can lead to problems when there are custom external dependencies which don't trigger a rebuild.

This command forces docusaurus to clear its cache and rebuild all files on the next start.

```bash
npm run --prefix website docusaurus clear
```

### (Re-)Install Packages

There are multiple reasons why reinstalling NPMs packages might fix some issues.
Some of the most common reasons could be:

- corrupted modules
- outdated packages ([`npm update`][guides-developing-website-update] could also resolve this)
- ...

```bash
rm -rf ./website/node_modules
npm install --prefix website
```
