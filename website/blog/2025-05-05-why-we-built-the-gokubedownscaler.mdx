# Why We Built the GoKubeDownscaler

The GoKubeDownscaler project is a big project and as such there had to have been good enough reasons to make it.
In the following blog we try to show our [reasons for making this project](#why-not-use-the-py-kube-downscaler),
[its design considerations](#general-design-considerations) and [how we want to move forward](#outlook).

{/* truncate */}

## Why Not Use the Py-Kube-Downscaler

The [Py-Kube-Downscaler](https://github.com/caas-team/py-kube-downscaler)
(or just known as the [kube-downscaler](https://codeberg.org/hjacobs/kube-downscaler) at the time)
was a popular tool for downscaling kubernetes workloads.
It had loads of configuration options and a big userbase.

Even with its many users and contributors
the project and its dependencies (like pykube) were over time all becoming unmaintained.
Additionally its codebase became cluttered over the years of being developed which made adding new features,
maintaining the repo and adding new resources hard to do and prone to introduce unwanted bugs.

With the py-kube-downscaler becoming unmaintained more and more bugs were slowly coming to the light of day.
At our company we also ran into some bugs which we tried to fix via a pr to the project.
However, since the project was no longer maintained our pr did not get merged.
After a few weeks we decided that we should maintain a fork of the project ourselves.
This also meant maintaining the [pykube](https://github.com/caas-team/new-pykube) (also known as pykube-ng and now new-pykube) dependency.

After we cleaned up the repo and fixed the bugs our prs were aiming to fix
we continued to maintain the project along with [Samuel](https://github.com/samuel-esp).
As more work was done on the project the above points about it being hard to maintain became clear.
This let us to decide that it was necessary to rewrite the project since doing a big refactoring would basically involve the same.

## The Reason for Choosing Golang

It soon became clear that rewriting the project in python would not be the best option,
as all native kubernetes libraries including ones for CRDs are either only available to [golang](https://go.dev) or native to it.

Golang also has many other advantages compared to python like being statically typed making collaboration easier,
having faster execution times thanks to compilation as well as generally being more efficient with memory management and other resources.

Go's concurrency model is also one of the easiest to work with this allowed us to build the downscaler
to use concurrent operations wherever possible making for scans to complete much faster.

{/* TODO: would be nice to have statistics here */}

In our team we were also already basically exclusively using golang for our other projects
which made it clear to us that using golang was the way to go.

## General Design Considerations

As said above the design of the Downscaler is made to be based on go's great concurrency.
This also makes [conflicts from workloads being modified](ref:docs-runtime-configurations#max-retries-on-conflict)
while they are being scanned less likely.

One of our main focuses is making this repo as easy to maintain and keep clean as possible.
To achieve this we are making use of [many strict linters](repo:.pre-commit-config.yaml)
and other tools like [dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot).

We also want to make sure that adding new resources is as easy as possible,
which is why we are planning on making all resources data driven allowing anyone in adding custom resources
or modify existing ones without touching or having any knowledge of the code.

It was also important to us that you can [run the downscaler locally](ref:contributing-developing-downscaler#running-the-downscaler-locally)
which greatly simplifies testing new features while developing.
This is done by if applicable having a runtime configuration
to substitute these in-cluster sources of data (e.g. [`-k`](ref:docs-runtime-configuration#kubeconfig) for setting the kubeconfig manually).

## Outlook

We plan to continue maintaining, improving and adding new features to the project.
With the GoKubeDownscaler soon being stable and feature complete
we are planning on concentrating on further development of the project
while we step back from developing new features for the py-kube-downscaler.

What this means is that in the future the py-kube-downscaler project
will only be maintained by dependency updates, security fixes and bug fixes.
The GoKubeDownscaler project will be the official successor to the old kube-downscaler
and will likely be the only downscaler that gets new features and improvements.

Any changes to the repo will continue to be strictly reviewed and tested by us maintainers and code quality/security tools.
We will adding more linters and general tools to make sure the projects code stays clean and its dependencies up-to-date

## Conclusion

In summary, the lack for good first party apis for python, go's efficiency
and the state of the py-kube-downscaler repo all led to the rewriting to the project in golang.
The kube-downscalers rewrite is more efficient and can handle larger clusters thanks to go
and we will continue to make sure that the GoKubeDownscaler's repo stays clean and easily maintainable.
