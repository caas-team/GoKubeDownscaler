### Testing the Downscaler

#### Running the Unit Tests

```

#### Running the Downscaler Locally

The downscaler can be run locally by specifying a kubeconfig to use.
The kubeconfig should have at least the permissions as the Helm Charts [role.yaml](./deployments/chart/templates/role.yaml).
The downscaler will use the current-context in the kubeconfig.

```bash
go run -k=path/to/kubeconfig # ... additional configuration
```

### Testing the Website

#### Installing Dependencies

```bash
npm install --prefix website
```

#### Running It Locally

```bash
npm run --prefix website start
```

after that the website is available on `localhost:3000/GoKubeDownscaler`
